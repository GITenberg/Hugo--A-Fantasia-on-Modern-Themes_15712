<h2>THE DOME</h2>


<p>He wakened from a charming dream, in which
the hat had played a conspicuous part.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't mind having that hat,' he
murmured.</p>

<p>A darkness which no eye could penetrate
surrounded him as he lay in bed. Absolute
obscurity was essential to the repose of that
singular brain, and he had perfected arrangements
for supplying the deficiencies of
Nature's night.</p>

<p>He touched a switch, and in front of him at
a distance of thirty feet the ivory dial of a
clock became momentarily visible under the
soft yellow of a shaded electric globe. It was
fifteen minutes past six. At the same
moment a bell sounded the quarter in delicate
tones, which fell on the ear as lightly as dew.
In the upper gloom could be discerned the
contours of a vast dome, decorated in turquoise-blue
and gold.</p>

<p>He pressed a button near the switch. A
porti&egrave;re rustled, and a young man approached
his bed&mdash;a short, thin, pale, fair young man,
active and deferential.</p>

<p>'My tea, Shawn. Draw the curtains and
open the windows.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said Simon Shawn.</p>

<p>In an instant the room was brilliantly
revealed as a great circular apartment,
magnificently furnished, with twelve windows
running round the circumference beneath the
dome. The virginal zephyrs of a July
morning wandered in. The sun, although
fierce, slanted his rays through the six eastern
windows, printing a new pattern on the
Tripoli carpets. Between the windows were
bookcases, full of precious and extraordinary
volumes, and over the bookcases hung pictures
of the Barbizon school. These books and
these pictures were the elegant monument of
hobbies which their owner had outlived.
His present hobby happened to be music. A
Steinway grand-piano was prominent in the
chamber, and before the ebony instrument
stood a mechanical pianoforte-player.</p>

<p>'I must have that hat.'</p>

<p>He paused reflectively, leaning on one
elbow, as he made the tea which Simon
Shawn had brought and left on the night-table.
And again, at the third cup, he
repeated to himself that he must possess the
hat.</p>

<p>He had a passion for tea. His servants had
received the strictest orders to supply him at
early morn with materials sufficient only for
two cups. Nevertheless, they were always a
little generous, and, by cheating himself
slightly in the first and the second cup, the
votary could often, to his intense joy, conjure
a third out of the pot.</p>

<p>After glancing through the newspaper
which accompanied the tea, he jumped vivaciously
out of bed, veiled the splendour of his
pyjamas beneath a quilted toga, and disappeared
into a dressing-room, whistling.</p>

<p>'Shawn!' he cried out from his bath, when
he heard the rattle of the tea-tray.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir?'</p>

<p>'Play me the Chopin Fantasie, will you. I
feel like it.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir,' said Simon, and paused.
'Which particular one do you desire me to
render, sir?'</p>

<p>'There is only one, Shawn, for piano solo.'</p>

<p>'I beg pardon, sir.'</p>

<p>The gentle plashing of water mingled with
the strains of one of the greatest of all musical
compositions, as interpreted by Simon Shawn
with the aid of an ingenious contrivance the
patentees of which had spent twenty thousand
pounds in advertising it.</p>

<p>'Very good, Shawn,' said Shawn's master,
coming forward in his shirt-sleeves as the last
echoes of a mighty chord expired under the
dome. He meditatively stroked his graying
beard while the pianist returned to the tea-tray.</p>

<p>'And, Shawn&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir?'</p>

<p>'I want a hat.'</p>

<p>'A hat, sir?'</p>

<p>'A lady's hat.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Run down into Department 42, there's
a good fellow, and see if you can find me a
lady's hat of dark-blue straw, wide brim,
trimmed chiefly with a garland of pinkish
rosebuds.'</p>

<p>'A lady's hat of dark-blue straw, wide
brim, trimmed chiefly with pinkish rosebuds,
sir?'</p>

<p>'Precisely. Here, you're forgetting the
token.'</p>

<p>He detached a gold medallion from his
watch-chain, and handed it to Shawn, who
departed with it and with the tea-tray.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, having climbed the
staircase between the inner and outer domes,
he stood, fully clad in a light-gray suit, on
the highest platform of the immense building,
whose occidental fa&ccedil;ade is the glory of Sloane
Street and one of the marvels of the metropolis.
Far above him a gigantic flag spread
its dazzling folds to the sun and the breeze.
On the white ground of the flag, in purple
letters seven feet high, was traced the single
word, 'HUGO.'</p>

<p>From his eyrie he could see half the West
End of London. Sloane Street stretched
north and south like a ruled line, and along
that line two hurrying processions of black
dots approached each other, and met and
vanished below him; they constituted the
first division of his army of three thousand
five hundred employ&eacute;s.</p>

<p>He leaned over the balustrade, and sniffed
the pure air with exultant, eager nostrils.
He was forty-six. He did not feel forty-six,
however. In common with every man of
forty-six, and especially every bachelor of
forty-six, he regarded forty-six as a mere
meaningless number, as a futile and even misleading
symbol of chronology. He felt that
Time had made a mistake&mdash;that he was not
really in the fifth decade, and that his true,
practical working age was about thirty.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was in love, for the first time
in his life. Like all men and all women, he
had throughout the whole of his adult existence
been ever secretly preoccupied with
thoughts, hopes, aspirations, desires, concerning
the other sex, but the fundamental
inexperience of his heart was such that he
imagined he was going to be happy because
he had fallen in love.</p>

<p>'I'm glad I sent for that hat,' he said,
smiling absently at the Great Wheel over a
mile and a half of roofs.</p>

<p>The key to his character and his career lay
in the fact that he invariably found sufficient
courage to respond to his instincts, and that
his instincts were romantic. They had led
him in various ways, sometimes to grandiose
and legitimate triumphs, sometimes to hidden
shames which it is merciful to ignore. In the
main, they had served him well. It was in
obedience to an instinct that he had capped
the nine stories of the Hugo building with a
dome and had made his bed under the dome.
It was in obedience to another instinct that
he had sent for the hat.</p>

<p>'Very pretty, isn't it?' he observed to
Shawn, when Simon handed him the insubstantial
and gay object and restored the gold
token. They were at a window in the circular
room; the couch had magically melted
away.</p>

<p>'I admire it, sir,' said Shawn, and withdrew.</p>

<p>'Dolt!' he cried out upon Shawn in his
heart. '<i>You</i> didn't see her at work on it.
As if <i>you</i> could appreciate her exquisite taste
and the amazing skill of her blanched fingers!
I alone can appreciate these things!'</p>

<p>He hung the hat on a Louis Quatorze
screen, and blissfully gazed at it, her creation.</p>

<p>'But I must be careful,' he muttered&mdash;'I
must be careful.'</p>

<p>A clerk entered with his personal letters.
It was scarcely seven o'clock, but these
fifteen or twenty envelopes had already been
sorted from the three thousand missives that
constituted his first post; he had his own
arrangement with the Post-Office.</p>

<p>'So it's coming at last,' he said to himself,
as he opened an envelope marked 'Private
and Confidential' in red ink. The autograph
note within was from Senior Polycarp, principal
partner in Polycarps, the famous firm
of company-promoting solicitors, and it
heralded a personal visit from the august
lawyer at 11.30 that day.</p>

<p>In the midst of dictating instructions to the
clerk, Mr. Hugo stopped and rang for Shawn.</p>

<p>'Take that back,' he commanded, indicating
the hat. 'I've done with it.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>The hat went.</p>

<p>'I may just as well be discreet,' his thought
ran.</p>

<p>But her image, the image of the artist in
hats, illumined more brightly than ever his
soul.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h2>THE ESTABLISHMENT</h2>


<p>Seven years before, when, having unostentatiously
acquired the necessary land, and
an acre or two over, Hugo determined to
rebuild his premises and to burst into full
blossom, he visited America and Paris, and
amongst other establishments inspected
Wanamaker's, the Bon March&eacute;, and the
Magasins du Louvre. The result disappointed
him. He had expected to pick up ideas, but
he picked up nothing save the Bon March&eacute;
system of vouchers, by which a customer
buying in several departments is spared the
trouble of paying separately in each department.
He came to the conclusion that the art
of flinging money away in order that it may
return tenfold was yet quite in its infancy.
He said to himself, 'I will build a <i>shop</i>.'</p>

<p>Travelling home by an indirect route, he
stopped at a busy English seaport, and saw a
great town-hall majestically rising in the
midst of a park. The beautiful building did
not appeal to him in vain. At the gates of
the park he encountered a youth, who was
staring at the town-hall with a fixed and
fascinated stare.</p>

<p>'A fine structure,' Hugo commented to the
youth.</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> think so,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'Can you tell me who is the architect?'
asked Hugo.</p>

<p>'I am,' said the youth. 'And let me beg
of you not to make any remark on my juvenile
appearance. I am sick of that.'</p>

<p>They lunched together, and Hugo learnt
that the genius, after several years spent in
designing the varnished interiors of public-houses,
had suddenly come out first in an open
competition for the town-hall; thenceforward
he had thought in town-halls.</p>

<p>'I want a shop putting up,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>The youth showed no interest.</p>

<p>'And when I say a shop,' Hugo pursued,
'I mean a <i>shop</i>.'</p>

<p>'Oh, a <i>shop</i> you mean!' ejaculated the
youth, faintly stirred. They both spoke in
italics.</p>

<p>'A <i>real</i> shop. Sloane Street. A hundred
and eighty thousand superficial feet. Cost a
quarter of a million. The finest shop in the
world!'</p>

<p>The youth started to his feet.</p>

<p>'I've never had any luck,' said he, gazing
at Hugo. 'But I believe you really do understand
what a shop ought to be.'</p>

<p>'I believe I do,' Hugo concurred. 'And I
want one.'</p>

<p>'You shall have it!' said the youth.</p>

<p>And Hugo had it, though not for anything
like the sum he had named.</p>

<p>The four frontages of his land exceeded in
all a quarter of a mile. The frontage to Sloane
Street alone was five hundred feet. It was
this glorious stretch of expensive earth which
inflamed the architect's imagination.</p>

<p>'But we must set back the fa&ccedil;ade twenty
feet at least,' he said; and added, 'That will
give you a good pavement.'</p>

<p>'Young man,' cried Hugo, 'do you know
how much this land has stood me in a
foot?'</p>

<p>'I neither know nor care,' answered the
youth. 'All I say is, what's the use of putting
up a decent building unless people can see it?'</p>

<p>Hugo yielded. He felt as though, having
given the genius something to play with, he
must not spoil the game. The game included
twelve thousand pounds paid to budding
sculptors for monumental groups of a symbolic
tendency; it included forests of onyx pillars
and pillars of Carrara marble; it included
ceilings painted by artists who ought to have
been R.A.'s, but were not; and it included a
central court of vast dimensions and many
fountains, whose sole purpose was to charm
the eye and lure the feet of customers who
wanted a rest from spending money. Whenever
Hugo found the game over-exciting, he
soothed himself by dwelling upon the wonderful
plan which the artist had produced, of his
extraordinary grasp of practical needs, and
his masterly solution of the various complicated
problems which continually presented
themselves.</p>

<p>After the last bit of scaffolding was removed
and the machine in full working order, Hugo
beheld it, and said emphatically, 'This will do.'</p>

<p>All London stood amazed, but not at the
austere beauty of the whole, for only a few
connoisseurs could appreciate that. What
amazed London was the fabulous richness, the
absurd spaciousness, the extravagant perfection
of every part of the immense organism.</p>

<p>You could stroll across twenty feet of
private tessellated pavement, enter jewelled
portals with the assistance of jewelled commissionaires,
traverse furlong after furlong of
vistas where nought but man was vile,
sojourn by the way in the concert-hall, the
reading-room, or the picture-gallery, smoke
a cigarette in the court of fountains, write a
letter in the lounge, and finally ask to be
directed to the stationery department, where
seated on a specially designed chair and surrounded
by the most precious manifestations
of applied art, you could select a threepenny
box of J pens, and have it sent home in a pair-horse
van.</p>

<p>The unobservant visitor wondered how
Hugo made it pay. The observant visitor
did not fail to note that there were more than
a hundred cash-desks in the place, and that
all the cashiers had the air of being overworked.
Once the entire army of cashiers,
driven to defensive action, had combined in
order to demand from Hugo, not only higher
pay, but an increase in their numbers. Hugo
had immediately consented, expressing regret
that their desperate plight had escaped his
attention.</p>

<p>The registered telegraphic address of the
establishment was 'Complete, London.'</p>

<p>This address indicated the ideal which Hugo
had turned into a reality. His imperial
palace was far more than a universal bazaar.
He boasted that you could do everything
there, except get into debt. (His dictionary
was an expurgated edition, and did not
contain the word 'credit.') Throughout life's
fitful fever Hugo undertook to meet all your
demands. Your mother could buy your
layette from him, and your cradle, soothing-syrup,
perambulator, and toys; she could
hire your nurse at Hugo's. Your school-master
could purchase canes there. Hugo
sold the material for every known game; also
sweets, cigarettes, penknives, walking-sticks,
moustache-forcers, neckties, and trouser-stretchers.
He shaved you, and kept the
latest in scents and kit-bags. He was unsurpassed
for fishing-rods, motor-cars, Swinburne's
poems, button-holes, elaborate bouquets,
fans, and photographs. His restaurant
was full of discreet corners with tables for two
under rose-shaded lights. He booked seats
for theatres, trains, steamers, grand-stands,
and the Empire. He dealt in all stocks and
shares. He was a banker. He acted as
agent for all insurance companies. He would
insert advertisements in the agony column, or
any other column, of any newspaper. If you
wanted a flat, a house, a shooting-box, a
castle, a yacht, or a salmon river, Hugo could
sell, or Hugo could let, the very thing. He
provided strong-rooms for your savings, and
summer quarters for your wife's furs; conjurers
to amuse your guests after dinner, and
all the requisites for your daughter's wedding,
from the cake and the silk petticoats to the
Viennese band. His wine-cellars and his
specific for the gout were alike famous; so
also was his hair-dye.... And, lastly,
when the riddle of existence had become too
much for your curiosity, Hugo would sell you
a pistol by means of which you could solve it.
And he would bury you in a manner first-class,
second-class, or third-class, according
to your deserts.</p>

<p>And all these feats Hugo managed to
organize within the compass of four floors, a
basement, and a sub-basement. Above, were
five floors of furnished and unfurnished flats.
'Will people of wealth consent to live over a
shop?' he had asked himself in considering
the possibilities of his palace, and he had
replied, 'Yes, if the shop is large enough and
the rents are high enough.' He was right.
His flats were the most sumptuous and the
most preposterously expensive in London;
and they were never tenantless. One man
paid two thousand a year for a furnished
suite. But what a furnished suite! The
flats had a separate and spectacular entrance
on the eastern fa&ccedil;ade of the building, with a
foyer that was always brilliantly lighted, and
elevators that rose and sank without intermission
day or night. And on the ninth floor
was a special restaurant, with prices to match
the rents, and a roof garden, where one of
Hugo's orchestras played every fine summer
evening, except Sundays. (The County
Council, mistrusting this aerial combination
of music and moonbeams, had granted its
license only on the condition that customers
should have one night in which to recover
from the doubtful influences of the other six.)
The restaurant and the roof-garden were a
resort excessively fashionable during the
season. The garden gave an excellent view
of the dome, where Hugo lived. But few
persons knew that he lived there; in some
matters he was very secretive.</p>

<p>That very sultry morning Hugo brooded
over the face of his establishment like a spirit
doomed to perpetual motion. For more than
two hours he threaded ceaselessly the long
galleries where the usual daily crowds of
customers, sales-people, shopwalkers, inspectors,
sub-managers, managers, and private
detectives of both sexes, moved with a strange
and unaccustomed languor in a drowsy atmosphere
which no system of ventilation could
keep below 75&deg; Fahrenheit. None but the
chiefs of departments had the right to address
him as he passed; such was the rule. He
deviated into the counting-house, where two
hundred typewriters made their music, and
into the annexe containing the stables and
coach-houses, where scores of vans and automobiles,
and those elegant coup&eacute;s gratuitously
provided by Hugo for the use of important
clients, were continually arriving and leaving.
Then he returned to the purchasing multitudes,
and plunged therein as into a sea. At
intervals a customer, recognising him, would
nudge a friend, and point eagerly.</p>

<p>'That's Hugo. See him, in the gray suit?'</p>

<p>'What? That chap?'</p>

<p>And they would both probably remark at
lunch: 'I saw Hugo himself to-day at Hugo's.'</p>

<p>He took an oath in his secret heart that he
would not go near Department 42, the only
department which had the slightest interest
for him. He knew that he could not be too
discreet. And yet eventually, without knowing
how or why, he perceived of a sudden that
his legs carried him thither. He stopped, at
a loss what to do, and then, by the direct
interposition of kindly Fate, a manager spoke
to him.... He gazed out of the corner of
his eye. Yes, she was there. He could see
her through a half-drawn porti&egrave;re in one of
the trying-on rooms. She was sitting limp
on a chair, overcome by the tropic warmth of
Sloane Street, with her noble head thrown
back, her fine eyes half shut, and her
beautiful hands lying slackly on her black
apron.</p>

<p>What an impeachment of civilization that
a creature so fair and so divine should be
forced to such a martyrdom! He desired
ardently to run to her and to set her free for
the day, for the whole summer, and on full
wages. He wondered if he could trust the
manager with instructions to alleviate her lot....
The next instant she sprang up, giving
the indispensable smile of welcome to some
customer who had evidently entered the
trying-on room from the other side. The
phenomenon distressed him. She disappeared
from view behind the porti&egrave;re, and
reappeared, but only for a moment, talking to
a foppish old man with a white moustache.
It was Senior Polycarp, the lawyer.</p>

<p>Hugo flushed, and, abandoning the manager
in the middle of a sentence, fled to his central
office. He had no confidence in his self-command....
Could this be jealousy?
Was it possible that he, Hugo, should be so
far gone? Nay!</p>

<p>But what was Polycarp, that old and
desiccated widower, doing in the millinery
department?</p>

<p>He said he must form some definite plan,
and begin by giving her a private room.</p>

<h2>HUGO EXPLAINS HIMSELF</h2>


<p>'And what,' asked Hugo, smiling faintly at
Mr. Senior Polycarp&mdash;'what is your client's
idea of price?'</p>

<p>For half an hour they had been talking in
the luxurious calm of Hugo's central office,
which was like an island refuge in the middle
of that tossing ocean of business. It overlooked
the court of fountains from the second
story, and the highest jet of water threw a
few jewelled drops to the level of its windows.</p>

<p>Mr. Polycarp stroked his beautiful white
moustache.</p>

<p>'We would give,' he said in his mincing,
passionless voice, 'the cost price of premises,
stock, and fixtures, and for goodwill seven
times your net annual profits. In addition,
we should be anxious to secure your services
as managing director for ten years at five
thousand a year, plus a percentage of profits.'</p>

<p>'Hum!'</p>

<p>'And, of course, if you wished part of the
purchase-money in shares&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Have you formed any sort of estimate of
my annual profits?' Hugo demanded.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;a sort of estimate.'</p>

<p>'You have looked carefully round, eh?'</p>

<p>'My clients have. I myself, too, a little.
This morning, for example. Very healthy,
Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>'What departments did you visit this
morning? Each has its busy days.'</p>

<p>'Grocery, electrical, and&mdash;let me see&mdash;yes,
furniture.'</p>

<p>'Not a good day for that&mdash;too hot! Anything
else?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Mr. Polycarp.</p>

<p>'Ah!... Well, and what is your clients'
estimate?'</p>

<p>'Naturally, I cannot pretend&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Listen, Mr. Polycarp,' said Hugo, interrupting: 'I
will be open with you.'</p>

<p>The lawyer nodded, appreciatively benign.
As usual, he kept his thoughts to himself, but
he had the air of adding Hugo to the vast
collection of human curiosities which he
had made during a prolonged professional
career.</p>

<p>'My net trading profits last year were
&pound;106,000. You are surprised?'</p>

<p>'Somewhat.'</p>

<p>'You expected a higher figure?'</p>

<p>'We did.'</p>

<p>'I knew it. And the figure might be higher
if I chose. Only I do things in rather a royal
way, you see. I pay my staff five hundred a
week more than I need. And I allow myself
to be cheated.' He laughed suddenly.
'Costume department, for instance. I send
charming costumes out on approval, and
fetch them back in two days. And the pretty
girls who have taken off the tickets, and worn
the garments, and carefully restored the
tickets, and lied to my carmen&mdash;the pretty
girls imagine they have deceived me. They
have merely amused me. My detective
reports are excellent reading. And, moreover,
I like to think that I have helped a
pretty girl to make the best of herself.'</p>

<p>'Immoral and unbusinesslike, Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>'Admitted. I have no doubt that if I put
the screw on all round I could quite justifiably
increase my profits by fifty per cent.'</p>

<p>'That shows what a splendid prospect a
limited company would have.'</p>

<p>'Yes, doesn't it?' said Hugo joyously.</p>

<p>'But why are your clients so anxious to turn
me into a limited company?'</p>

<p>'They see in your undertaking,' replied
Polycarp, folding his thin hands, 'a legitimate
opening for that joint-stock enterprise which
has had such a beneficial effect on England's
prosperity.'</p>

<p>'They would make a profit?'</p>

<p>'A reasonable profit. A small syndicate
would be formed to buy from you, and that
syndicate would sell to a public company.
The usual thing.'</p>

<p>'And where do I come in?'</p>

<p>'Where do you come in, my dear Mr.
Hugo? Everywhere! You would receive
over a million in cash. You would have your
salary and your percentage, and you would be
relieved of all your present risks.'</p>

<p>'All my present risks?'</p>

<p>'You have risks, Mr. Hugo, because your
business has increased so rapidly that your
income is out of all proportion to your capital,
which consists almost solely of buildings
which you could not sell at anything like their
cost price in open market, and of goodwill.
Now, I ask you, what is goodwill? What <i>is</i>
it? Under our scheme you would at once
become a millionaire in actual fact.'</p>

<p>'Decidedly an inviting prospect,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>He walked about the room.</p>

<p>'Then I may take it that you are at any
rate prepared to negotiate?' the lawyer
ventured, staring at the fountain.</p>

<p>'Mr. Polycarp,' answered Hugo, 'I must
first give you a little information and ask you
a few questions.'</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>Hugo halted in front of Polycarp, close to
him, and, lighting a cigar, gazed down at the
frigid lawyer.</p>

<p>'Till the age of twenty-eight,' he began, 'I
had no object in life. I was educated at
Oxford. I narrowly escaped the legal profession.
I had a near shave of the Church.
I wasted years in aimless travel, waiting for
destiny to turn up. I was conscious of no gift
except a power for organizing. That gift I
felt I had, and gradually I perceived that I
would like to be the head of some large and
complicated undertaking. I examined the
latest developments of modern existence, and
came to the conclusion that the direction of a
thoroughly up-to-date stores would amuse me
as well as anything. So I bought this concern&mdash;a
flourishing little drapery and furnishing
business it was then. I had exactly fifty
thousand pounds&mdash;not a cent more. I paid
twenty-five thousand for the business. It
was too much, but when an idea takes me it
takes me. I required a fine-sounding name,
and I chose Hugo. It was an inspiration.'</p>

<p>'Then Hugo is not your&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It is not. My real name is Owen. But
think of "Owen" on a flag, and then think of
"Hugo" on a flag.'</p>

<p>'Exactly.'</p>

<p>'I began. And because I had everything
to learn I lost money at first. I took lessons
in my own shop, and the course cost me a
hundred a week for some months. But in
two years I had proved that my theory of
myself was correct. In ten I had made
nearly a quarter of a million. Everyone
knows the history of my growth.'</p>

<p>Polycarp nodded.</p>

<p>'In the eleventh year I determined to
emerge from the chrysalis. I dreamed a
dream of my second incarnation as universal
tradesman. And the fabric of my dream,
Mr. Polycarp, you behold around you.' He
waved the cigar. 'It is the most colossal
thing of its kind ever known.'</p>

<p>Polycarp nodded again.</p>

<p>'Some people regard it as extravagant. It
is. It is meant to be. Hugo's store is only
my fun, my device for amusing myself. We
have glorious times here, I and my ten
managers&mdash;my Council of Ten. They know
me; I know them. They are well paid; they
are artists. A trade spirit must, of course,
actuate a trade concern; but above that,
controlling that, is another spirit&mdash;the spirit
which has made this undoubtedly the greatest
shop in the world. I cannot describe it, but
it exists. All my managers, and even many
of the rank and file, feel it.'</p>

<p>'Very interesting,' said the lawyer.</p>

<p>'Mr. Polycarp,' Hugo announced solemnly,
'the direction of this establishment is my life.
In the midst of this lovely and interesting
organism I enjoy every hour of the day.
What else can I want?'</p>

<p>Polycarp raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>'Do you suppose it would add to my fun to
have a million in the bank&mdash;I, with an income
of two thousand a week? Do you suppose
I should find it diverting to be at the beck and
call of a board of directors&mdash;I, the supreme
fount of authority? Do you suppose it would
be my delight to consider eternally the
interests of a pack of shareholders&mdash;I, who
consider nothing but my fancy? And, finally,
do you suppose it would amuse me, Hugo, to
have "limited" put after my name? Me,
limited!'</p>

<p>'Then,' said the lawyer slowly, 'I am to
understand you are not willing&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My friend,' Hugo replied, dropping into
his chair, 'I would sooner see the whole
blessed place fall like the Bastille than see it
"limited."'</p>

<p>Polycarp rose in his turn.</p>

<p>'My clients,' he remarked in a peculiar
tone, 'had set their minds on this affair.'</p>

<p>'For once in a way your clients will be disappointed,'
said Hugo.</p>

<p>'What do you mean&mdash;"for once in a
way"?'</p>

<p>'Who are your clients, Mr. Polycarp?'</p>

<p>'Since the offer is rejected, it would be
useless to divulge their names.'</p>

<p>'I will tell you, then,' said Hugo. 'Your
client&mdash;for there is only one&mdash;is Louis Ravengar.
I saw it stated in a paper the other day
that Louis Ravengar had successfully floated
thirty-nine companies with a total capitalization
of thirty millions. But my scalp will
not be added to his collection.'</p>

<p>'I shall not disclose the identity of my
clients,' Mr. Polycarp minced. 'But, speaking
of Mr. Ravengar, I have noticed that what
he wants he gets. The manner in which the
United Coal Company, Limited, was brought
to flotation by him in the teeth of the opposition
of the proprietors was really most interesting.'</p>

<p>'You mean to warn me that there are ways
of compelling a private concern to become
public and joint-stock?'</p>

<p>'Not at all, Mr. Hugo. I am incapable of
such a hint. I am sure that nothing and
nobody could force you against your will. I
was only mentioning the case of the Coal
Company. I could mention others.'</p>

<p>'Don't trouble, my dear sir. Convey my
decision to Louis Ravengar, and give him my
compliments. We are old acquaintances.'</p>

<p>'You are?' The solicitor seemed astonished
in his imperturbable way.</p>

<p>'We are.'</p>

<p>'I will convey your decision to my
clients.'</p>

<p>Accepting a cigar, Mr. Polycarp departed.</p>

<p>Without giving himself time to think, Hugo
went straight to Department 42, and direct
to the artist in hats. She stood pale and
deferential to receive him. The heat was
worse than ever.</p>

<p>'Your name is Payne, I think?' he began.
(He well knew her name was Payne.)</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>Other employ&eacute;s in the trying-on room
looked furtively round.</p>

<p>'About half-past eleven an old gentleman,
with white moustache, came into this room,
Miss Payne. You remember?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'What did he want?'</p>

<p>'He was inquiring about a hat, sir,' she
hurriedly answered.</p>

<p>'For a lady?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Thank you.'</p>

<p>And he hastened back to his central office,
and breathed a sigh. 'I have actually spoken
to her,' he murmured. 'How charming her
voice is!'</p>

<p>But Miss Payne's physical condition desolated
him. If she was so obviously exhausted
at 12.30, what would she be like at the day's
end?'</p>

<p>'I've got it!' he cried.</p>

<p>He seized a pen and wrote: 'Notice.&mdash;The
public are respectfully informed that this
establishment will close to-day at two o'clock.'</p>

<p>He rang a bell, and a messenger appeared.</p>

<p>'Take this to the printing-office instantly,
and tell Mr. Waugh it must be posted throughout
the place in half an hour.'</p>

<p>Shortly after two o'clock Sloane Street was
amazed to witness the exodus of the three
thousand odd. The closure was attributed
to a whim of Hugo's for celebrating some
obscure anniversary in his life. Many hundreds
of persons were inconvenienced, and
the internal economy of scores of polite homes
seriously deranged. The evening papers
found a paragraph. And Hugo lost perhaps
a hundred and fifty pounds net. But Hugo
was happy, and he was expectant.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock that night a youngish man,
extremely like Simon Shawn, was brought by
Simon into Hugo's presence under the dome.
This was Simon's brother, Albert Shawn, a
member of Hugo's private detective force.</p>

<p>'Sit down,' said Hugo. 'Well?'</p>

<p>'I reckon you've heard, sir,' Albert Shawn
began impassively, 'the yarn that's going all
round the stores.'</p>

<p>'I have not.'</p>

<p>'Everyone's whispering,' said Albert Shawn,
gazing carefully at his boots, 'that Mr. Hugo
has taken a kind of a fancy to Miss Payne.'</p>

<p>Hugo restrained himself.</p>

<p>'Heavens!' he exclaimed, with a clever
affectation of lightness, 'what next? I've
only spoken to the chit once.'</p>

<p>'Don't I know it, sir!'</p>

<p>'Enough of that! What have you to
report?'</p>

<p>'Miss Payne left at 2.15, whipped round to
the flats entrance, took the lift to the top-floor,
went into Mr. Francis Tudor's flat.'</p>

<p>'What's that you say? Whose flat?'
cried Hugo.</p>

<p>'Mr. Francis Tudor's, sir.'</p>

<p>Mr. Tudor was famous as the tenant of the
suite rented at two thousand a year; he had
a reputation for being artistic, sybaritic, and
something in the inner ring of the City.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Hugo. 'Perhaps she is a friend
of one of Mr. Tudor's&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Servants,' he was about to say, but the
idea of Miss Payne being on terms of equality
with a menial was not pleasant to him, and
he stopped.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' said Albert Shawn, unmoved.
'She is not, because Mr. Tudor shunted out
all his servants soon afterwards. Miss Payne
was shown into his study. She had her tea
there, and her dinner. The Hugo half-guinea
dinner was ordered late by telephone
for two persons, and rushed up at eight
o'clock.'</p>

<p>'I wonder Mr. Tudor didn't order an
orchestra with the dinner,' said Hugo grimly.
It was a sublime effort on his part to be his
natural self.</p>

<p>'I waited for Miss Payne to leave,' continued
Albert Shawn. 'That's why I'm so
late.'</p>

<p>'And what time did she leave?'</p>

<p>'She hasn't left,' said Albert Shawn.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h2>CAMILLA</h2>


<p>Hugo dismissed Albert, with orders to continue
his vigil, and then he rang for Simon.</p>

<p>'Do you think I might have some tea?'
he asked.</p>

<p>'I am disposed to think you might, sir,'
said Simon the cellarer. 'It is eight days
since you indulged after dinner.'</p>

<p>'Bring me one cup, then, poured out.'</p>

<p>He was profoundly disturbed by Albert's
news. He was, in fact, miserable. He had
a physical pain in the region of the heart. He
wished he could step off Love as one steps off
an omnibus, but he found that Love resembled
an express train more than an omnibus.</p>

<p>'Can she be secretly married to him?' he
demanded half aloud, sipping at the tea.</p>

<p>The idea soothed him exactly as much as
it alarmed him.</p>

<p>'The question is,' he murmured angrily,
'am I or am I not an ass?... At my
age!'</p>

<p>He felt vaguely that he was not, that he was
rather a splendid and Byronic figure in the
grip of tremendous emotions.</p>

<p>Having regretfully finished the tea, he unlocked
a bookcase, and picked out at random
a volume of Boswell's 'Johnson.' It was the
modern Oxford edition&mdash;the only edition
worthy of a true amateur&mdash;bound by Rivi&egrave;re.
Like all wise and lettered men, Hugo consulted
Boswell in the grave crises of life, and
to-night he happened upon the venerable
Johnson's remark: <i>'Sir, I would be content
to spend the remainder of my existence driving
about in a post-chaise with a pretty woman.'</i></p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and laughed.
'In the whole history of mankind,' he asserted
to the dome, 'there have only been two
really sensible men. Solomon was one, and
Johnson the other.'</p>

<p>He restored the book to its place, and sat
down to the piano-player, and in a moment
the overture to 'Tannh&auml;user,' that sublime
failure to prove that passion is folly, filled the
vast apartment. The rushing violin passages,
and every call of Aphrodite, intoxicated his
soul and raised his spirits till he knew with the
certainty of a fully-aroused instinct that
Camilla Payne must be his. He became
optimistic on all points.</p>

<p>'A lady insists on seeing you, sir,' said
Simon Shawn, intruding upon the Pilgrims'
Chant.</p>

<p>'She may insist,' Hugo answered lightly.
'But it all depends who she is. I'm&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped, for the insisting lady had
entered.</p>

<p>It was Camilla.</p>

<p>He jumped up. Never before in his
career had he been so astounded, staggered,
charmed, enchanted, dazzled, and completely
silenced.</p>

<p>'Miss Payne?' he gasped after a prolonged
pause.</p>

<p>Simon Shawn effaced himself.</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>'Won't you sit down?'</p>

<p>The singular prevalence of beautiful women
in England is only appreciated properly by
Englishmen who have lived abroad, and these
alone know also that in no other country
is beauty wasted by women as it is wasted
in England. Camilla was beautiful, and
supremely beautiful; she was tall, well and
generously formed, graceful, fair, with fine
eyes and fine dark chestnut hair; her absolutely
regular features had the proud Tennysonian
cast. But the coldness of Tennysonian
damsels was not hers. Whether she had
Latin blood in her veins, or whether Nature
had peculiarly gifted her out of sheer caprice,
she possessed in a high degree that indescribable
demeanour, at once a defiance and
a surrender, a question and an answer, a
confession and a denial, which is the universal
weapon of women of Latin race in the battle
of the sexes, but of which Englishwomen seem
to be almost deprived. 'I am Eve!' say the
mocking, melting eyes of the Southern woman,
and so said Camilla's eyes. No man could
rest calm under that glance; no man could
forbear the attempt to decipher the hidden
secrecies of its message, and no man could
succeed in the task.</p>

<p>Hugo felt that he had never seen this
woman before.</p>

<p>And he might have been excused for feeling
so; for instead of the black alpaca, Camilla
now wore a simple but effectively charming
toilette such as 'Hugo's' created and sold to
women for the rapture of men in summer twilights,
and over the white dress was thrown
a very rich pearl-tinted opera-cloak, which
only partly concealed the curves of the
shoulders, and poised aslant on the glistening
coiffure was the identical blue hat with its wide
brims that had visited the dome seventeen
hours before. The total effect was calculated,
perfect, overwhelming.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Hugo,' said
Camilla, throwing back her cloak on the left
side with a fine gesture, 'but I am in need of
your assistance.'</p>

<p>'Yes?' Hugo whispered, seating himself.</p>

<p>She had a low voice, rare in a blonde, and
it thrilled him. And she was so near him in
the great chamber!</p>

<p>'I want you to tell me what plot I am in
the midst of. What is the web that has
begun to surround me?'</p>

<p>'Plot?' stammered Hugo. 'Web?'</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed scrutinizingly on his face.</p>

<p>'You have a kind heart,' she said; 'everybody
can see that. Be frank. Do you know,'
she asked in a different tone, 'or don't you,
that you spoke very gruffly to me this
morning?'</p>

<p>'Miss Payne,' he began, 'I assure you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I thought perhaps you didn't know,' she
smiled calmly. 'But you did speak very
gruffly. Now, I have taken my courage in
both hands in order to come to you to-night.
I may have lost my situation through it&mdash;I
can't tell. Whether I have lost my situation
or not, I appeal to you for candour.'</p>

<p>'Miss Payne,' said Hugo, 'it distresses me
to hear you speak of a "situation."'</p>

<p>'And why?'</p>

<p>'You know why,' he answered. 'A woman
as distinguished as you are must be perfectly
well aware how distinguished she is, and perfectly
capable, let me add, of hiding her distinction
from the common crowd. For what
purpose of your own you came into my shop,
I can't guess. But necessity never forced
you there. No doubt you meant to avoid
getting yourself talked about; nevertheless,
you have got yourself talked about.'</p>

<p>'Indeed!' She looked at him sideways.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Hugo went on; 'several thousands
of commonplace persons are saying that I
have fallen in love with you. Do you think
it's true, this rumour?'</p>

<p>'How can I tell you?' said she.</p>

<p>'Well, it is true!' he cried. 'It's doubly
and trebly true! It's the greatest truth in
the world at the present moment. It is one
of those truths that a believer can't keep to
himself.' He paused, expectant. 'A woman
less fine than you would have protested
against this sudden avowal, which is only too
like me&mdash;too like Hugo. You don't protest.
I knew you wouldn't. I knew you knew.
You asked for candour. You have it. I
love you.'</p>

<p>'Then, why,' she demanded firmly, with a
desolating smile&mdash;'why do you have me followed
by your private detective?'</p>

<p>Hugo was caught in a trap. He had hesitated
long before instructing Albert Shawn to
shadow Camilla, but in the end his desire for
exact knowledge concerning her, and his
possession of a corps of detectives ready to
hand, had proved too much for his scruples.
He had, however, till that day discovered
little of importance for his pains&mdash;merely that
her parents, who were dead, had kept a small
milliner's shop in Edgware Road, that her
age was twenty-five, that she had come to his
millinery department with a good testimonial
from an establishment in Walham
Green, that she lived in lodgings at Fulham
and saw scarcely anyone, and that she had
once been a typewriter.</p>

<p>'The fact is&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped, perceiving that the 'fact'
would not do at all, and that to explain to the
woman you love why you have spied on her
is a somewhat nice operation.</p>

<p>'Is that the way you usually serve us?'
pursued Camilla, with a strange emphasis on
the word 'us' which maddened him.</p>

<p>'The fact is, Miss Payne,' he said boldly,
sitting down as soon as he had invented the
solution of the difficulty, 'you will not deny
that this afternoon and this evening you have
been in a position of some slight delicacy.
What your relations are with Mr. Francis
Tudor I have never sought to inquire, but I
have always doubted the bon&acirc; fides of Mr.
Francis Tudor. And to-day I have simply&mdash;if
I may say so&mdash;watched over you. If my
man has been clumsy, I beg your forgiveness.
I beg you to believe in my deep respect for
you.'</p>

<p>The plain sincerity of his accent and of his
gaze touched and convinced her. She looked
at her feet, white-shod on the crimson carpet.</p>

<p>'Ah!' she murmured, as if to herself,
mournfully, 'why don't you ask me how it
is that I, to whom you pay thirty-six shillings
a week, am wearing these clothes? Surely
you must think that an employ&eacute; who&mdash;'</p>

<p>'At this hour you are not an employ&eacute;,' he
interrupted here. 'You visit me of your own
free will to demand an explanation of matters
which are quite foreign to our business relations.
I give it you. Beyond that I permit
myself no thoughts except such as any man
is entitled to concerning any woman. You
used the word "plot" when you came in.
What did you refer to? If Mr. Tudor
has&mdash;' He could not proceed.</p>

<p>'As I left Mr. Tudor's flat a few minutes
since,' said Camilla quietly, producing a
revolver from the folds of her cloak, 'I picked
up this. It may or may not be loaded.
Perhaps you can tell me.'</p>

<p>He seized the weapon, and impetuously
aimed at a heavy Chinese gong across the
room, and pulled the trigger several times.
The revolver spoke noisily, and the gong
sounded and swung.</p>

<p>'You see!' he exclaimed. 'Pardon the
din. I did it without thinking.'</p>

<p>'Did you call, sir?' asked Simon Shawn,
appearing in the doorway.</p>

<p>Hugo extirpated him with a look.</p>

<p>'How cool you are!' he resumed to Camilla,
and laid down the revolver. 'No, you aren't!
By Jove, you aren't! What is it? What
have you been through? What is this
plot? A plot&mdash;in my building&mdash;and against
you! Tell me everything&mdash;everything! I
insist.'</p>

<p>'Shall you believe all that I say?' she
ventured.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'all.'</p>

<p>He saw with intense joy that he was going
to be friendly with her. It seemed too good
to be true.</p>

<h2>A STORY AND A DISAPPEARANCE</h2>


<p>'Perhaps I ought to begin by informing you,'
said Camilla Payne, 'that I have known
Mr. Francis Tudor for about two years.
Always he has been very nice to me. Once
he asked me to marry him&mdash;quite suddenly&mdash;it
was a year ago. I refused because I didn't
care for him. I then saw nothing of him for
some time. But after I entered your service
here, he came across me again by accident.
I did not know until lately that he had one of
your flats. He was very careful, very polite,
timid, cautious&mdash;but very obstinate, too. He
invited me to call on him at his rooms, and
to bring any friends I liked. Of course, it
was a stupidity on his part, but, then, what
else could he do? A man who wants to
cultivate relations with a homeless shopgirl
is rather awkwardly fixed.'</p>

<p>'I wish to Heaven you would not talk like
that, Miss Payne!' said Hugo, interrupting her
impatiently.</p>

<p>'I am merely telling you these things so
that you may understand my position,'
Camilla coldly replied. 'Do you imagine
that I am amusing myself?'</p>

<p>'Go on, go on, I beg,' he urged, with a
gesture of apology.</p>

<p>'Naturally, I declined the invitation. Then
next I received a letter from him, in which
he said that unless I called on him, or agreed
to meet him in some place where we could talk
privately and at length, he should kill himself
within a week. And he added that death
was perhaps less to him than I imagined.
I believed that letter. There was something
about it that touched me.'</p>

<p>'And so you decided to yield?'</p>

<p>'I did yield. I felt that if I was to trust
him at all, I might as well trust him fully,
and I called at his flat this afternoon alone.
He was evidently astonished to see me at that
hour, so I explained to him that you had closed
early for some reason or other.'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>He insisted on giving me tea. I was
treated, in fact, like a princess; but during
tea he said nothing to me that might not have
been said before a roomful of people. After
tea he left me for a few moments, in order, as
he said, to give some orders to his servants.
Up till then he had been extremely agitated,
and when he returned he was even more
agitated. He walked to and fro in that
lovely drawing-room of his&mdash;just as you were
doing here not long since. I was a little
afraid.'</p>

<p>'Afraid of what?' demanded Hugo.</p>

<p>'I don't know&mdash;of him, lest he might do
something fatal, irretrievable; something&mdash;I
don't know. And then, being alone with
him in that palace of a place! Well, he
burst out suddenly into a series of statements
about himself, and about his future, and his
intentions, and his feelings towards me. And
these statements were so extraordinary and so
startling that I could not think he had invented
them. I believed them, as I had
believed in the sincerity of his threat to kill
himself if I would not listen to him.'</p>

<p>'And what were they&mdash;these statements?'
Hugo inquired.</p>

<p>Camilla waved aside the interruptions, and
continued: '"Now," he said, "will you
marry me? Will you marry me now?"'</p>

<p>She paused and glanced at Hugo, who
observed that her eyes were filling with
tears.</p>

<p>'And then?' murmured Hugo soothingly.</p>

<p>'Then I agreed to marry him.'</p>

<p>And with these words she cried openly.</p>

<p>'If anyone had told me beforehand,' she
resumed, 'that I should be so influenced by a
man's&mdash;a man's acting, I would have laughed.
But I was&mdash;I was. He succeeded completely.'</p>

<p>'You have not said what these extraordinary
statements were,' Hugo insisted.</p>

<p>'Don't ask me,' she entreated, drying her
eyes. 'It is enough that I was hoodwinked.
If you have had no hand in this plot, don't
ask me. I am too ashamed, too scornful of my
credulity, to repeat them. You would laugh.'</p>

<p>'Should I?' said Hugo, smiling gravely.
'What occurred next?'</p>

<p>'The next step was that Mr. Tudor asked me
to accompany his housekeeper to the housekeeper's
room, and on the other side of the
passage from the drawing-room I was to dine
with him. The housekeeper is a Mrs. Dant,
a kind, fat, lame old woman, and she produced
this cloak and this hat, and so on, and said
that they were for me! I was surprised, but I
praised them and tried them on for a moment.
You must remember that I was his affianced
wife. I talked with Mrs. Dant, and prepared
myself for dinner, and then I went back to
the drawing-room, and found Mr. Tudor
ready for dinner. I asked him why he had
got the clothes, and he said he had got them
this very morning merely on the chance of
my accepting his proposal out of pity for him.
And I believed that, too.'</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>'But that is not the end?' Hugo encouraged
her.</p>

<p>'Oh,' she exclaimed, 'it is useless, all this
story! And the episode is finished! When
I came in here I was angry; I suspect you
of some complicity. But I suspect you no
longer, and I see now that the wisest
course for a woman such as I after such an
adventure is to be mute about it, and to
forget it.'</p>

<p>'No,' he said; 'you are wrong. Trust me.
I entreat.'</p>

<p>Camilla bit her lip.</p>

<p>'We went into the dining-room, and dinner
was served,' she recommenced, 'and there I
had my first shock, my first doubt, for one of
the two waiters was your spy.'</p>

<p>'Shawn! My detective!'</p>

<p>Hugo was surprised to find that Albert,
almost a novice in his vocation, had contrived
to be so insinuating.</p>

<p>'And he made a very bad waiter indeed,'
Camilla added.</p>

<p>'I regret it,' said Hugo. 'He meant well.'
'When the waiters had gone I asked Mr.
Tudor if they were his own servants. He
hesitated, and then admitted frankly that
they were not. He told me that his servants
were out on leave for the evening. "You
don't mean to say that I am now alone with
you in the flat!" I protested. "No," he
said quickly. "Mrs. Dant is always in her
room across the passage. Don't be alarmed,
dearest." His tone reassured me. After
coffee, he took my photograph by flashlight.
He printed one copy at once, and then, after
we had both been in the dark-room together,
he returned there to get some more printing-paper.
While he was absent I went into
the housekeeper's room for a handkerchief
which I had left there. Mrs. Dant was not
in the room. But in a mirror I saw the reflection
of a man hiding behind the door. I was
awfully frightened. However, I pretended
to see nothing, and tried to hum a song. I
same into the passage. The passage window
was open, and I looked out. Another man
was watching on the balcony. Of course, I
saw instantly it was a plot. I&mdash;I&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Did you recognise the men, then?' Hugo
asked.</p>

<p>'The one in the room I was not quite sure
of. The other, on the balcony, was your
detective, I think. I saw him disappear in
this direction.'</p>

<p>'But whatever the plot was, Shawn had no
hand in it.'</p>

<p>'No, no, of course not! I see now. But
the other, in the room! Ah, if you knew all
my history, you would understand better!
I felt that some vengeance was out against me.
I saw everything clearly. I tried to keep my
head, and to decide calmly what I ought to do.
It was from a little table in the passage that
I picked up the revolver. Then I heard
hurried footsteps coming through the drawing-room
towards the passage. It was Mr.
Tudor. He seemed very startled. I tried
to appear unconcerned. "What is the
matter?" he asked; he had gone quite pale.
"Nothing," I said. "I only went to fetch
a handkerchief." He laughed uneasily. "I
was afraid you had thought better of it and
run away from me," he said. And he kissed
me; I was obliged to submit. All this time
I was thinking hard what to do. I suggested
we should go on to the roof garden for awhile.
He objected, but finally he gave way, and he
brought me the cloak and hat, and we went
to the garden and sat down. I felt safer
there. At last I ventured to tell him that I
must go home. Of course, he objected to that
too, but he gave way a second time. "I
will just speak to Mrs. Dant," I said. "You
stay here for three minutes. By that time I
shall be ready." And I went off towards the
flat, but as soon as I was out of his sight I
turned and ran here. And that's all.'</p>

<p>'You are a wonderful creature,' Hugo murmured,
looking at her meditatively.</p>

<p>'Why?' The question was put with a sort
of artless and melancholy surprise.</p>

<p>'How can I tell?' said Hugo. 'How can
I tell why Heaven made you so?'</p>

<p>She laughed, and the laugh enchanted him.
He had studied her during her recital; he
had observed her continual effort to use
ordinary words and ordinary tones like a
garment to hide vivid sensations and emotions
which, however, shone through the garment
as her face might have shone through a veil.</p>

<p>He recalled her little gestures, inflections,
glances&mdash;the thousand avenues by which her
rich and overflowing individuality escaped
from the prison of her will, and impressed
itself on the rest of the created universe. Her
story was decidedly singular, and as mysterious
as it was singular; that something
sinister would be brought to light, he felt sure.
But what occupied and charmed his mind was
the exquisite fact that between him and her
relations were now established. The story,
her past danger, even her possible future
danger&mdash;these things only interested him in so
far as they formed the basis of an intimacy.
He exulted in being near her, in the savour of
her commanding presence. When he thought
of her in his monstrous shop, wilting in the
heat, bowing deferentially to fools, martyrizing
her soul for less than two pounds a week,
he thought of kings' daughters sold into
slavery. But she was a princess now, and
for evermore, and she had come to him of her
own free will; she had trusted him; she had
invited his help! It was glorious beyond the
dreams of his passion.</p>

<p>'Come,' he said feverishly, 'show me how
you managed to get to my dome.'</p>

<p>And he threw open the easternmost window,
and she stepped with him out on to the
balcony.</p>

<p>They looked down across Hugo's little
private garden, into the blackness of the court
of fountains, whose balconies were vaguely
disclosed here and there by the reflection from
lit interiors. On the other side of the deep
pit of the court was the vast expanse of flat
roof containing the famous roof garden. Amid
dwarf trees and festoons of coloured lights,
the figures of men and women who counted
themselves the cream of London could dimly
be seen walking about or sitting at tables;
and the wild strain of the Tsigane musicians,
as they swayed to and fro in their red coats
on the bandstand, floated towards the dome
through the heavy summer air. In the near
distance the fantastic shapes of chimney-cowls
raised themselves against the starry but
moonless sky, and miles away the grandiose
contours of a dome far greater than Hugo's&mdash;the
dome of St. Paul's&mdash;finished the prospect
in solemn majesty. It was a scene well
calculated to intensify a man's emotions,
especially when a man stands to view it, as
Hugo stood, on a lofty balcony, with a beautiful
and loved woman by his side.</p>

<p>She was indicating pathways, as well as
she could, when they both saw a man hurrying
in the direction of the dome along by the roof-balustrade
of the court of fountains&mdash;the
route by which Camilla herself had come.
He arrived under the dome, and would have
disappeared into a doorway had not Hugo
called:</p>

<p>'Shawn, I'm here!'</p>

<p>'I was just coming to see you, sir,' replied
Albert Shawn in a loud whisper, as he climbed
breathless up to the little raised garden
beneath the dome.</p>

<p>Camilla withdrew behind a curtain of the
window.</p>

<p>'Well?' Hugo queried.</p>

<p>'She's gone, sir. But dashed if I know
where, unless she's got herself lost somewhere
on the roof.'</p>

<p>'She is here,' said Hugo, lowering his voice.
'And it appears that you waited very clumsily
at that dinner, my boy. A bad disguise is
worse than none. I must lend you Gaboriau's
"Crime of Orcival" to read; that will teach
you. Anything else to tell me?'</p>

<p>'I went back to the balcony entrance of the
flat,' the youthful detective replied humbly,
looking up to Hugo in the window of the
dome. 'I could see through the lacework of
the blind; the drawing-room was empty.
The French window was open an inch or so,
and I could hear a clock ticking as clear as a
bell. Then Mr. Tudor toddled up, and I hid
in the servants' doorway. Mr. Tudor went
in by the other door, and out I popped again
to my post. I see my gentleman stamping
about and calling "Camilla! Camilla!" fit to
burst. No answer. Then he picks up a photograph
off a table and kisses it smack&mdash;twice.'</p>

<p>Camilla stirred behind the curtain.</p>

<p>'Then he goes into another room,' proceeded
Albert Shawn, 'and lo and behold!
another man comes from round the corner of
a screen&mdash;a man much older than Mr. Tudor!
And Mr. Tudor runs in again, and these
two meet&mdash;these two do. And they stare
at each other, and Mr. Tudor says, "Hullo,
Louis&mdash;"'</p>

<p>'I knew it!' The cry came from Camilla
within the dome.</p>

<p>'What?' demanded Hugo, turning to her
and ignoring Shawn.</p>

<p>'It was Louis Ravengar whom I saw hiding
behind the door. I felt all the time that it
was he!'</p>

<p>And she put her hands to her face.</p>

<p>'Ravengar!' He was astounded to hear
that name. What had she, what had Tudor,
to do with Ravengar?</p>

<p>'That was why I thought <i>you</i> were in the
plot, Mr. Hugo,' she added.</p>

<p>'Me? Why?'</p>

<p>'Can you ask?'</p>

<p>Her eyes met his, and it was his that
fell.</p>

<p>'I have no relations whatever with Ravengar,
I assure you,' he said gravely. 'But, by
the dagger! I'll see this affair to the end.'
'By the dagger' was a form of oath, meaningless
yet terrible in sound, which Hugo employed
only on the greatest occasions. He
turned sharply to the window. 'Anything
else, Shawn?'</p>

<p>'There was a gust of wind that shut the
blessed window, sir. I couldn't hear any
more, so I came to report.'</p>

<p>'Go to the front entrance of the flat instantly,'
Hugo ordered him. 'I will watch the
balcony.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>Camilla was crouching in the embrasure of
the window. Her body seemed to shake.</p>

<p>'There is nothing to fear,' Hugo soothed
her. 'Stay here till I return.' And he
snatched up the revolver.</p>

<p>'No,' she said, straightening herself; 'I
must go with you.'</p>

<p>'Better not.'</p>

<p>'I must go with you,' she repeated.</p>

<p>They passed together along the railed edge
of the court of fountains under the stars,
skirted the gay and melodious garden behind
the trees in their huge wooden boxes, and so
came to a second quadrangle, upon whose
highest story the windows of Tudor's flat
gave. Descending a stairway of forged iron
to the balcony, they crept forward in silence
to the window of Tudor's drawing-room, and,
still side by side, gazed, as Shawn had done,
through the fine lacework of the blind into
the splendid apartment.</p>

<p>The window was almost at a corner of the
room, near a door; but Hugo had a perfect
view of the two men within, and one was as
certainly Louis Ravengar as the other was
Francis Tudor. They were gesticulating
violently and angrily, and a heavy, ornate
Empire chair had already been overturned.
The dispute seemed to be interminable; each
moment heralded a fight, but it is the watched
pot that never boils. Suddenly Hugo became
aware that Camilla was no longer at his elbow,
and the next instant, to his extreme amazement,
he saw her glide into the room. She
had removed her hat and cloak, and stood
revealed in all her beauty. The two men
did not perceive her. She softly opened the
window, and the confused murmur of voices
reached Hugo's ear.</p>

<p>'Give me the revolver,' Camilla whispered.</p>

<p>And her whisper was such that he passed
the weapon, as it were hypnotically, to her
under the blind. And then the blind slipped
down, and he could see no more. He heard
a shot, and the next thing was that the revolver
was pushed back to him, nearly at the
level of the floor.</p>

<p>'Wait there!' The sound of her voice,
tense and authoritative, came through the
slit of the window and thrilled him. 'All is
well now, but I will send you a message.'</p>

<p>And the window was swiftly closed and a
curtain drawn behind the blind. He could
hear nothing.</p>

<p>He had small intention of obeying her.
'She must have gone in by the servants'
entrance,' he argued. 'I should have seen
her if she had tried the other.' And he ran
to the small door, but it was shut fast. In
vain he knocked and shook the handle for
several minutes. Then he hastened to the
main door on the broad balcony, but that also
was impregnable.</p>

<p>Should he break a pane?</p>

<p>A noise far along the balcony attracted him.
He flew towards it, found nothing but a cat
purring, and returned. The luscious music of
the Tsigane band, one of the nine orchestras
which he owned, reached him faintly over the
edge of the quadrangle.</p>

<p>Then he decidedly did hear human footsteps
on the balcony. They were the footsteps of
Shawn.</p>

<p>'She's gone, sir. Took the lift, and whizzed
off in Mr. Tudor's electric brougham that was
waiting.'</p>

<p>'And the men?' he gasped.</p>

<p>'Seen neither of them, sir. She put this
note in my hand as she passed me, sir.'</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h2>A LAPSE FROM AN IDEAL</h2>


<p>'If you please, sir,' said Simon Shawn, when
he brought Hugo's tea the next morning, 'I
am informed that a man has secreted himself
on the summit of the dome.'</p>

<p>Hugo, lying moveless on his back, and
ignoring even the tea, made no reply to this
speech. He was still repeating to himself the
following words, which, by constant iteration,
had assumed in his mind the force and emphasis
of italics: <i>'So grateful for your sympathetic
help. When next I see you, if there is
opportunity, I will try to thank you. Meantime,
all is well with me. Please trouble no
more. And forget.'</i> Such were the exact
terms of the note from Camilla Payne delivered
to him by Albert Shawn. Of course, he knew
it by heart. It was scribbled very hastily in
pencil on half a sheet of paper, and it bore no
signature, not even a solitary initial. If it
had not been handed to Albert by Camilla in
person, Hugo might have doubted its genuineness,
and might have spent the night in transgressing
the law of trespass and other laws,
in order to be assured of a woman's safety.
But under the circumstances he could not
doubt its genuineness. What he doubted was
its exact import. And what he objected to
in it was its lack of information. He wished
ardently to know whether Ravengar and
Tudor, or either of them, had been wounded,
and if so, by whose revolver; for he could not
be certain that it was Camilla who had fired.
An examination of the revolver which he and
she had passed from hand to hand had shown
two chambers undischarged. He wished
ardently to know how she had contrived to
settle her account with Tudor, and yet get
away in Tudor's brougham, unless it was by
a wile worthy of the diplomacy of a Queen
Elizabeth. And he wished ardently to understand
a hundred and one other things concerning
Camilla, Tudor, and Ravengar, and
the permutations and combinations of these
three, which offered apparently insoluble
problems to his brain. Nevertheless, there
was one assurance which seemed to him to
emerge clearly from the note, and to atone for
its vagueness&mdash;a vagueness, however, perfectly
excusable, he reflected, having regard
to the conditions in which it was written&mdash;namely,
that Camilla intended to arrive, as
usual, in Department 42 that morning. What
significance could be attached to the phrase,
'When next I see you, <i>if there is opportunity</i>,'
unless it signified that she anticipated seeing
him next in the shop and in the course of
business? Moreover, he felt that it would
be just like Camilla to start by behaving to
him as though nothing had occurred. (But
he would soon alter that, he said masterfully.)
He was, on the whole, happy as he lay in bed.
She knew that he loved her. They had been
intimate. In three hours at most he would
see her again. And his expectations ran high.
Indeed, she had already begun to exist in his
mind as his life's companion.</p>

<p>Simon coughed politely but firmly.</p>

<p>'What's that you say?' Hugo demanded;
and Simon repeated his item of news.</p>

<p>'Ha!' said Hugo; 'doubtless some enthusiast
for sunrises.'</p>

<p>'He has been twice perceived in the little
gallery by the men cleaning the roof garden,'
Simon added.</p>

<p>'And who is it?'</p>

<p>'His identity has not been established,' said
Simon.</p>

<p>'Can't you moderate your language a
little, Shawn?' Hugo asked, staring always
absently up into the dome.</p>

<p>'I beg pardon, sir. I have spent part of
the night with Albert, and his loose speech
always drives me to the other extreme,'
Simon observed, repentant.</p>

<p>'Has Albert seen the burglar?'</p>

<p>'No, sir, if it <i>is</i> a burglar.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Hugo, 'he's quite safe where he
is. He can't get down except by that door,
can he?' pointing to a masked door, which
was painted to represent a complete set in
sixty volumes of the 'Acts of the Saints.'</p>

<p>'No, sir.'</p>

<p>'And he could only have got up by that
door?' Hugo pursued.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Which means that you were away from
your post last night, my son.'</p>

<p>'I was, sir,' Shawn admitted frankly.
'When you and Albert and the lady ran off so
quickly, I followed, as far as I judged expedient&mdash;beg
pardon, sir. The man must
have slipped in during my absence. I remember
I noticed the masked door was ajar
on my return. I shut and locked it.'</p>

<p>'That explains everything,' said Hugo.
'You see how your sins find you out.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'I say, Shawn,' Hugo cried, as he went to
his bath, 'talking of that chap up above, play
me the Captives' chorus from "Fidelio."'</p>

<p>'It is not in the r&eacute;pertoire, sir,' said Simon,
after searching.</p>

<p>'Not in the r&eacute;pertoire! Impossible!'</p>

<p>'No, sir.'</p>

<p>'Ah well, then, let us have the Wedding
March from "Lohengrin."'</p>

<p>'With pleasure, sir.'</p>

<p>But Simon was unfortunate that morning.
The toilet completed, Hugo came towards
him swinging the gold token, the bearer of
which had the right to take whatever he chose
from all the hundred and thirty-one departments
of the stores in exchange for a simple
receipt.</p>

<p>'I will interview the burglar,' said Hugo.
'But just run down first and get me a pair of
handcuffs.'</p>

<p>In ten minutes Simon returned crestfallen.</p>

<p>'We do not keep handcuffs, sir,' he stammered.</p>

<p>'Not&mdash;keep&mdash;! What nonsense! First
you tell me that "Fidelio" is not in the r&eacute;pertoire,
and then you have the effrontery to add
that we do not keep handcuffs. Shawn, are
you not aware that the fundamental principle
of this establishment is that we keep everything?
If we received an order for a herd of
white elephants&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No doubt our arrangement with Jamrach's
would enable us to supply them, sir,' Simon
put in rapidly. 'But handcuffs seem to be a
monopoly of the State.'</p>

<p>'Evidently, Shawn, you are not familiar
with the famous remark of Louis the Fourteenth.'</p>

<p>'I am not, sir.'</p>

<p>'He said, "<i>L'&eacute;tat, c'est moi</i>." Show me the
catalogue.'</p>

<p>Simon, bearing on his shoulders at that
moment the sins of ten managers, scurried to
bring an immense tome, bound in crimson
leather, and inscribed in gold, 'Hugo, General
Catalogue.' It contained nearly two thousand
large quarto pages, and above six thousand
illustrations. Hugo turned solemnly to the
exhaustive index, which alone occupied
seventy pages of small type, and, running
his finger down a column, he read out,
Handbells, handbell-ringers, handbills, hand-embroidered
sheets, handkerchiefs, handles,
handsaws, hansoms, Hardemann's beetle
powder, hares, haricot beans....'</p>

<p>'Lamentable!' he ejaculated&mdash;'lamentable!
You will tell Mr.&mdash;Mr. Banbury this
morning to procure some handcuffs, assorted
sizes, at once, and to add them to the&mdash;the&mdash;Explorers'
Outfit Department.'</p>

<p>'Precisely, sir.'</p>

<p>'In the meantime I shall have to ascend
the dome, and face the burglar without this
necessary of life. Give me the revolver
instead.'</p>

<h2>POSSIBLE ESCAPE OF SECRETS</h2>


<p>The top of the dome was fashioned into a kind
of belvedere, with a small circular gallery.
Hugo emerged at the head of the stairs, and
saw no living thing; but at the sound of his
footstep a man sprang nervously into view
round the curve of the gallery, and fronted
him.</p>

<p>Hugo, with his hands still on either rail of
the staircase, took the top step, gazing the
while at his burglar, first in wonder, and then
with a capricious abandonment to what he
considered the humour of the situation. He
thought of Albert Shawn's account of the
meeting between Francis Tudor and his visitor
in Tudor's flat on the previous night, and
some fantastic impulse, due to the strain of
Welsh blood in him, caused him to address the
man as Tudor had addressed him:</p>

<p>'Hullo, Louis!'</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then came the reply
in a tone which might have been ferocious or
facetious:</p>

<p>'Well, my young friend?'</p>

<p>It was indeed Louis Ravengar. Dishevelled,
fatigued, and unstrung, he formed a
sinister contrast to Hugo, fresh from repose,
cold water and music, and also to the spirit
of the beautiful summer morning itself, which
at that unspoilt hour seemed always to
sojourn for a space in the belvedere. The sun
glinted joyously on the golden ornament of the
dome, and on Hugo's smooth hair, but it
revealed without pity the stains on Ravengar's
flaccid collar and the disorder of his
evening clothes and opera-hat.</p>

<p>He was a fairly tall man, with thin gray
hair round the sides of his head, but none on
the crown nor on his face, the chief characteristics
of which were the square jaw, the
extremely long upper lip, the flat nose, and
the very small blue-gray eyes. He looked
sixty, and was scarcely fifty. He looked one
moment like a Nonconformist local preacher
who had mistaken his vocation; but he was
nothing of the kind. He looked the next
moment like a good hater and a great scorner
of scruples; and he was.</p>

<p>These two men had not exchanged a word,
had not even seen each other, save at the
rarest intervals, for nearly a quarter of a
century. They were the principals in a
quarrel of the most vivid, satanic, and incurable
sort known to anthropological science&mdash;the
family quarrel&mdash;and the existence of this
feud was a proof of the indisputable truth
that it sometimes takes less than two to make
a quarrel. For, though Owen Hugo was not
absolutely an angel, Ravengar had made it
single-handed.</p>

<p>The circumstances of its origin were quite
simple. When Louis Ravengar was nine
years old, his father, a widower, married a
widow with one child, aged six. That child
was Hugo. The two lads, violently different
in temperament&mdash;the one gloomy and secretive,
the other buoyant and frank&mdash;with no
tie of blood or of affection, were forced by
destiny to grow up together in the same house,
and by their parents even to sleep in the same
room. They were never apart, and they loathed
each other. Louis regarded young Owen as
an interloper, and acted towards him as boys
and tigers will towards interlopers weaker
than themselves. The mischief was that
Owen, in course of years, became a great
favourite with his step-father. This roused
Louis to a fury which was the more dangerous
in that Owen had begun to overtake him in
strength, and the fury could, therefore, find
no outlet. Then Owen's mother died, and
Ravengar, senior, married again&mdash;a girl this
time, who soon discovered that the household
in which she had planted herself was far too
bellicose to be comfortable. She abandoned
her husband, and sought consolation and
sympathy with another widower, who also
was blessed with offspring. Such is the
foolishness of women. You cannot cure a
woman of being one. But it must be said in
favour of the third Mrs. Ravengar and her
consoler that they conducted their affair with
praiseworthy attention to outward decency.
She went to America by one steamer, and
purchased a divorce in Iowa for two hundred
dollars. He followed in the next steamer,
and they were duly united in Minneapolis.
Meanwhile, the Ravengar household, left to
the ungoverned passions of three males, became
more and more impossible, and at length
old Ravengar expired. In his will he stated
that it was only from a stern sense of justice
that he divided his considerable fortune in
equal shares between Louis and Owen. Had
he consulted his inclination, he would have
left one shilling to Louis, and the remainder
to Owen, who alone had been a true son to
him.</p>

<p>It was a too talkative will. Testators, like
politicians, should never explain.</p>

<p>Louis, who got as a favour half the fortune
of which the whole was, in his opinion, his by
right, was naturally exasperated in the highest
degree by the terms of the indiscreet testament,
and on the day of the funeral he parted
from the son of his step-mother, swearing, in
a somewhat melodramatic manner, that he
would be revenged. Hugo was then twenty-one,
and for twenty-five years he had waited
in vain for symptoms of the revenge.</p>

<p>And now they met again, in the truest
sense strangers. And each had a reason for
humouring the other, for each wanted to
know what the other had to do with Camilla
Payne.</p>

<p>'So you're determined, Louis,' said Hugo
lightly, 'to bring me to my knees about the
transfer of my business to a limited company,
eh?'</p>

<p>'What on earth do you mean, man?'
asked Ravengar, whose voice was always
gruff.</p>

<p>'I refer to Polycarp's visit yesterday.'</p>

<p>'I know nothing of it,' said Ravengar
slowly, looking across the wilderness of roofs.</p>

<p>'Then why are you here, Louis? Is your
revenge at last matured?'</p>

<p>Ravengar controlled himself, and glanced
round as if for unseen aid in a forlorn enterprise.</p>

<p>'Owen,' he said, moved, 'I'm here because
I need your help. I won't say anything
about the past. I know you were always
good-natured. And you've worn better than
I have. I need your help in a matter of
supreme importance to me. I became aware
last night that you and your men were interested
in the proceedings at Tudor's flat. I
ran here, meaning to see you. There was no
one in the big circular room downstairs, and
no one at the entrance. Then I saw your
servant coming, and I retreated through the
door. I wished my presence to be known
only to you. The door was locked on me. I
knocked in vain. Then I stumbled up the
stairs, and found myself out here. I wanted
to calm myself, and here I remained. I knew
your habit of coming up here at early morning.
That is the whole explanation of my
presence.'</p>

<p>Hugo nodded.</p>

<p>'I guessed as much,' he said. 'I will help
you if I can. But first tell me what happened
in the flat last night after Miss Payne entered
while you and Tudor were quarrelling. She
fired on you?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Ravengar; 'I believe she would
have done. It was Tudor who drew a revolver
and fired. Had I had my own&mdash;But
I had laid it on a table, like a fool, and
it disappeared.'</p>

<p>'Is not this it?' asked Hugo, producing
Camilla's weapon.</p>

<p>Ravengar nodded, amazed.</p>

<p>'I thought so,' Hugo said, and returned it
to his pocket. 'Were you wounded?'</p>

<p>'It was nothing. A scratch on the wrist.
See! But I left. She&mdash;she ordered me to.
And I saw I had no chance. I came out by
the principal door on the balcony while you
were struggling with the servants' door.'</p>

<p>'Wait a moment,' Hugo put in. 'Tudor
knew you were hiding in the flat?'</p>

<p>'Not much!' exclaimed Ravengar. 'I
dropped on him like something out of the
sky. It cost me some trouble to get in. I
had a silly old housekeeper to dispose of.'</p>

<p>Hugo's heart fell.</p>

<p>'Great heavens!' he sighed.</p>

<p>'Why? What's the matter?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. But tell me what you wanted
to get into the flat for at all. What is there
between you and Tudor?'</p>

<p>'Man! he's taken Camilla from me!' The
accents of rage and despair were in Ravengar's
voice as he uttered these words. 'He's taken
her from me! She was my typewriter, you
know. I fell in love with her. We were
engaged!'</p>

<p>Hugo was startled for a moment; then he
smiled bitterly and incredulously. It seemed
too monstrous and absurd that Camilla should
have betrothed herself to this forbidding, ugly,
ageing, and terrible man.</p>

<p>'You were engaged? Never! Perhaps you
aren't aware that she was engaged to Tudor?'</p>

<p>'I tell you we were engaged.'</p>

<p>'She accepted you?'</p>

<p>'Why not? I meant well by the girl.'</p>

<p>'And then she disappeared?'</p>

<p>Hugo spoke with a certain cynicism.</p>

<p>'How do you know?' Ravengar demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>'I only guess.'</p>

<p>'Well, she did. I can't imagine why. I
meant well by her. And the next thing is, I
find her working in your shop, and in the
arms of that scoundrel, Tudor.' He hesitated,
and then, as he proceeded, his tones softened
to an appeal. 'Owen, why were you watching
last night? I must know. It's an affair
of life or death to me.'</p>

<p>Hugo did not believe most of Ravengar's
story, and he perceived the difficulty of his
own position and the necessity for caution.</p>

<p>'I was watching because Miss Payne
thought herself in some mysterious danger,'
he said.</p>

<p>'She came to me, as you have done, to
ask my help. And I won't hide from you
that it was she herself who informed me
definitely that Tudor had invited her to
marry him, and that she had consented.'</p>

<p>'She shall not marry him!' cried Ravengar,
exasperated.</p>

<p>'You are right,' said Hugo. 'She shall
not. I have yet to be convinced even that
he meant to marry her.'</p>

<p>'The rascal! He and I had business relations
for several years before I discovered
who he was. Of course, you know?'</p>

<p>'Indeed I don't,' said Hugo, 'if he isn't
Francis Tudor.'</p>

<p>'He has as much right to the name of
Tudor as you have to the name of Hugo,'
Ravengar sneered. 'He is the son of the
man who dishonoured my father's name by
pretending to marry that woman in Minneapolis.
Even if I hated my father, I've no
cause to love <i>that</i> branch of our complicated
family connections.'</p>

<p>Hugo whistled.</p>

<p>'I did not think there was so much money
there,' he said at length.</p>

<p>'There wasn't. The fellow came into
twenty thousand two years ago, and he has
never earned a cent.'</p>

<p>'Yet he's living at the rate of five thousand
a year at least.'</p>

<p>'It's like him!' Ravengar snorted. 'It's
like him!'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he can't help it,' Hugo said
queerly. 'Everyone isn't like you and me.'</p>

<p>'He can help robbing me of my future
wife!'</p>

<p>'But she left you of her own accord.'</p>

<p>'Owen, she must marry me. It is essential.
You must bring your influence to bear,'
Ravengar burst out wildly. 'She must be
my wife!'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' Hugo protested calmly,
'what are you dreaming of? I have no
influence. You talk like a man at his wits'
end.'</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>'I am a man at his wits' end,' Ravengar
murmured, half sadly. 'I trusted that girl.
She knows all my secrets.'</p>

<p>'What secrets?' asked Hugo, struck by
the phrase.</p>

<p>'My business secrets, of course. What
else do you fancy?'</p>

<p>'My fancy is too active,' said Hugo, with
careful casualness. 'It runs away with me.
I was thinking of other sorts of secrets, and
of that curious principle of English law that
a wife can't give evidence against her husband....
You must pardon my fancy,'
he added.</p>

<p>'Do you mean to insinuate that my eagerness
to marry Camilla Payne is in order to
prevent her from being able to&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, Louis; I mean to insinuate nothing.
Can't you see a joke?'</p>

<p>'I cannot,' said Ravengar. 'Not that
variety of joke.'</p>

<p>'The appreciation of humour was never your
strong point.'</p>

<p>Something in Hugo's manner made Ravengar
spring forward; then he checked himself.</p>

<p>'Owen,' he entreated, 'don't let's quarrel
again. I beg you to help me. Help me, and
I'll promise never to interfere with you in
your business&mdash;I'll swear it.'</p>

<p>'Then it was you, after all, that instructed
Polycarp?'</p>

<p>Ravengar gave an affirmative sign.</p>

<p>'I meant either to get hold of this place or
to ruin you. Remember what I suffered&mdash;in
the old days.... You see I'm frank with
you. Help me. We're neither of us growing
younger. I'm mad for that girl, and I
must have her.'</p>

<p>Hugo put his hands into his pockets, and
consulted his toes. This semi-step-brother of
his somehow aroused his compassion.</p>

<p>'No, Louis,' he said; 'I can't.'</p>

<p>'You hate me?'</p>

<p>'Not a bit.'</p>

<p>'Do you think I'm too old to marry, or
what is it?'</p>

<p>'It's just like this, Louis, my friend: I
have every intention of marrying Miss Payne
myself.'</p>

<p>'You!... Ah!... Indeed!'</p>

<p>'I have so decided. And when I decide,
the thing is as good as done.'</p>

<p>'And that's why you were watching last
night! Good! Oh, good! Only I may as
well inform you, Owen, that if Camilla Payne
marries anyone but me, there will be murder.
And no ordinary murder, either!'</p>

<p>Hugo took a turn in the gallery. He felt
genuinely sorry for the gray and desperate
man, driven by the intensity of emotion to
utterances which were merely absurd.</p>

<p>'Louis,' he remarked, with a melancholy
kindliness of tone, 'fate has a grudge against
us two. It ruined our youth, and now it's
embroiling us once more. Can't we both be
philosophical? Can't we contrive to look at
the thing in a&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Enough!' Ravengar almost yelled. 'You
always talked that kind of d&mdash;&mdash;d nonsense,
you did! Unless you can arrange to say
you'll give her up, you may as well hold your
tongue.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' said Hugo, 'I'll hold my
tongue.'</p>

<p>'That's all, then?'</p>

<p>'Quite all.'</p>

<p>'I suppose I can go? You'll let me pass?
You'll not exercise your right to treat me as
a burglar?'</p>

<p>'There are the stairs. Pass Shawn boldly.
He is terrible, but he will not eat you.'</p>

<p>'Thanks.'</p>

<p>'And that is the unrivalled company promoter!
And this is life!' Hugo meditated
when he was alone on the dome.</p>

<p>He leaned over the railing of the gallery,
and watched his legions gathering for the
day's battle.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h2>ORANGE-BLOSSOM</h2>


<p>Some two hours later Hugo was in one of the
common rooms devoted to the leisure and
diversion of the legions in the upper basement:
a large and bright apartment, ornamented
with bookcases, wicker chairs, and reproductions
of all that was most uplifting in graphic
art. It was the domain of the ladies engaged
in Departments 30 to 45, and was managed
by an elected committee of their number.
Affixed to the walls, in and out among the
specimens of graphic art, were quite a lot of
little red diamond squares, containing in
white the words, 'Do it now,' in excessively
readable letters. A staff notice about the
early closing of the previous day had been
pinned up near the door, and printed information
relating to a trip to the Isle of Man,
balloting for the use of motor-cars on Sundays,
and a gratis book entitled 'Human Nature in
Shoppers,' were also prominent. Above the
fireplace was a fine mirror, and Hugo was
personally engaged in pasting on the mirror a
fine and effective poster, which ran as follows:</p>

<p>'Interesting. Last year the sales of the
Children's Boot and Shoe Department surpassed
the sales of the Ladies' Ditto by &pound;558.
In the first half of this year, on the contrary,
the sales of the Ladies' Boot and Shoe Department
have surpassed the sales of the Children's
Ditto by &pound;25. Great credit is due to the staff
of the L.B. and S.D. But will the staff of the
C.B. and S.D. allow themselves to be thus
wiped out? That is the question, and Mr.
Hugo will watch for the answer. Managers'
Council, July 10th.'</p>

<p>Hugo, as the supreme head of Hugo's, had
organized his establishment in such a manner
as to leave no regular duties for himself, conformably
to the maxim that a well-managed
business is a business which runs smoothly
and efficiently when the manager is not
managing, and to that other maxim that the
highest aim of the competent manager should
be to make himself unnecessary. Hence he
was perfectly at liberty to be wayward and
freakish in his activities from time to time.
And this happened to be one of his wayward
and freakish mornings. There were, however,
few young women in the common room
to behold his aberration, for the hour was
within two minutes of nine, and at nine o'clock
the latest of the legionaries was supposed to
be at her post. Three girls who were being
hastily served with glasses of milk by a pink-aproned
waitress politely feigned not to see
him. Then another girl ran in, and she, too,
had to pretend that the spectacle of Hugo
pasting posters on mirrors was one of the
most ordinary in life. Hugo glanced at this
last comer in the mirror, and sighed a secret
disappointment.</p>

<p>The interview with Louis Ravengar had
left him less perturbed than might be imagined&mdash;at
any rate, as regards Ravengar's own
share in what had occurred and what was to
occur. He was inclined to leave Ravengar
out of the account, and to put the greater
part of his hysterical appeals and threats
down to the effect of a sleepless and highly
unusual night. That Ravengar was absolutely
sincere in his desire to marry Camilla
he did not doubt, and he fully shared the
frenzied man's determination that Camilla
should not marry Francis Tudor. But beyond
this Hugo did not go. He certainly did not
go so far as to believe that Camilla had ever
formally engaged herself to Ravengar. He
thought it just possible that Ravengar might
have committed a crime, or several crimes,
and that Camilla might have knowledge of
them, but the question whether Ravengar
was or was not a criminal appeared to him
to be a little off the point.</p>

<p>The unique point was his own prospects
with Camilla. It may be said that he felt
capable of shielding her from forty Ravengars.</p>

<p>He had torn prudence to shreds, and
stamped on it, that morning, and had gone
down boldly and directly to Department 42
at a quarter to nine, in order to meet Camilla.
And she had not then arrived. He had then
conceived the idea of, and the excuse for, a
visit to the common room, through which
every assistant was obliged to pass on her
way to the receipt of custom. In the whole
history of Hugo's a poster had never before
been known to be posted on a mirror, which
is utterly the wrong place for a poster, but
Hugo had chosen the mirror as the field of
his labours solely that he might surreptitiously
observe every soul that entered the
room.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck
nine, and the last assistant had fled, and
Hugo was left alone with the pink-aproned
waitress, who was collecting glasses on a
tray.</p>

<p>'Has Miss Payne come this morning?' he
asked casually of the girl, patting the poster
like an artist absorbed in his work.</p>

<p>It was a reckless question. He well knew
that in half an hour the whole basement
would be aware that Mr. Hugo had asked
after Miss Payne, but he scorned the whole
basement.</p>

<p>'Miss who, sir?'</p>

<p>'Miss Payne, of the millinery department.'</p>

<p>'A tall young lady, sir?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'With chestnut hair?'</p>

<p>'Now you have me,' he lied.</p>

<p>'I fancy I know who you mean, sir; and
now I come to think of it, I don't think she
has.'</p>

<p>The waitress spoke in an apologetic tone,
and looked at the clock with an apologetic
look. She was no fool, that waitress.</p>

<p>'Thank you.'</p>

<p>As he left the room Albert Shawn entered
by the other door, and, perceiving nobody
but the waitress, kissed the waitress, and
was kissed by her heartily.</p>

<p>Hugo's deportment was debonnair, but his
heart had seriously sunk. Just as he had
before been quite sure that Camilla would
come as usual, now he was quite sure that
she would not come as usual. Ever since he
had learnt from Ravengar that Tudor had
been ignorant of Ravengar's presence in the
flat, and that Ravengar had had to 'dispose
of' the housekeeper, a horrid suspicion had
lurked at the back of his mind, and now this
suspicion sprang out upon his hopes of
Camilla's arrival, and fairly strangled them.
And the suspicion was that Camilla had misjudged
Francis Tudor, that his intentions had
throughout been perfectly honourable, and
that on her return to the flat he had quickly
convinced Camilla of this.</p>

<p>In which case, where did he, Hugo, come
in?</p>

<p>As for the terms of the note, he perceived
that he had interpreted them in a particular
way because he wished to interpret them in a
particular way.</p>

<p>He ascended in the direction of Department
42. Perhaps, after all, she had escaped
his vigilance, and was at her duties.</p>

<p>On the way thither he was accosted by a
manager.</p>

<p>'Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>'Well, Banbury?'</p>

<p>'I telephoned to New Scotland Yard, but
they refused any information. However, I've
got a pair from the nearest police-station. I
shall order our blacksmiths to make a dozen
pairs to pattern. They will be in next month's
catalogue.'</p>

<p>'I congratulate you, Banbury.'</p>

<p>And he passed on. The early-rising customers
were beginning to invade the galleries,
the cashiers in their confessional-boxes were
settling themselves in their seats, faultless
shopwalkers were giving a final hitch to their
lovely collars, and the rank-and-file were preparing
to receive cavalry. The vast machine
had started, slowly and deliberately, as an
express engine starts. And already the heat,
as yesterday, was formidable. But <i>she</i> would
not suffer to-day; she was not in Department
42.</p>

<p>He went further and further, aimlessly
penetrating to the very heart of the jungle
of departments. He had glimpses of departments
that he had not seen for weeks. At
length he came to the verdant and delicious
Flower Department (hot-house branch), and
by chance he caught a word which brought
him to a standstill.</p>

<p>'What's that?' he asked sharply, of a
salesman in white.</p>

<p>'Order for orange-blossom, sir. A single
sprig only. Rather a curious order, sir.'</p>

<p>'You can supply it?'</p>

<p>'Without doubt, sir.'</p>

<p>'Who is the customer?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Francis Tudor,' replied the salesman,
looking at a paper. 'No. 7, the Flats.'</p>

<p>'Ah yes,' he said; and thought: 'My life
is over.'</p>

<p>He gazed with unseeing eyes into the green
and shady recesses of the palmarium, where
water trickled and tinkled.</p>

<p>What was the power, the influence, the
lever, which Francis Tudor was using to
induce Camilla to marry him&mdash;him whom,
on her own statement, she did not love?
And could Louis Ravengar be in earnest,
after all, with his savage threats?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h2>'WHICH?'</h2>


<p>'And when I decide, the thing is as good as
done.' Those proud, vain words of his,
spoken to Louis Ravengar with all the arrogance
of a man who had never met Fate like
a lion in the path, often recurred to Hugo's
mind during the next few weeks. And their
futility exasperated him. He had decided to
win Camilla, and therefore Camilla was as
good as won! Only, she had been married
on the very morning of those boastful words
by license at a registry-office to Francis Tudor.
The strange admixture of orange-blossom and
registry-office was not the only strange thing
about the wedding. It was clear, for example,
that Tudor must have arranged the preliminaries
of the ceremony before the bride's consent
had been obtained&mdash;unless, indeed,
Camilla had garbled the truth to Hugo on
the previous night; and Hugo did not believe
this to be possible.</p>

<p>Albert Shawn had brought the news hour
by hour to Hugo.</p>

<p>After the wedding, the pair drove to Mr.
Tudor's flat, where Senior Polycarp paid
them a brief visit.</p>

<p>Then Hugo received by messenger a note
from Tudor formally regretting that his wife
had left her employment without due notice,
and enclosing a cheque for the amount of a
month's wages in lieu thereof.</p>

<p>And then Mr. and Mrs. Tudor had departed
for Paris by the two-twenty Folkstone-Boulogne
service from Charing Cross. And
the gorgeous flat was shut up.</p>

<p>Albert Shawn had respectfully inquired
whether there remained anything else to be
done in the affair, far more mysterious to
Albert than it was even to Hugo.</p>

<p>'No,' Hugo had said shortly.</p>

<p>He was Hugo, with extraordinary resources
at hand, but a quite ordinary circumstance,
such as ten minutes spent in a registry-office,
will sometimes outweigh all the resources in
the world when the success of a scheme hangs
in the balance.</p>

<p>What could he do, in London or in Paris,
civilized and police-ridden cities?</p>

<p>Civilization left him but one thing to do&mdash;to
acknowledge his defeat, and to mourn the
incomparable beauty and the distinguished
spirit which had escaped his passionate grasp.
And to this acknowledgment and this mourning
he was reduced, feeling that he was no
longer Hugo.</p>

<p>It was perhaps natural, however, that his
employ&eacute;s should have been made to feel that
he was more Hugo than ever. For a month
he worked as he had never worked before,
and three thousand five hundred people, perspiring
under his glance and under the sun of
a London August, knew exactly the reason
why. The intense dramatic and sentimental
interest surrounding Camilla Payne's disappearance
from Department 42 was the sole
thing which atoned to the legionaries for the
inconvenience of Hugo's mistimed activity.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he fell limp; he perceived
the uselessness of this attempt to forget in
Sloane Street, and he decided to try the banks
of a certain trout-stream on Dartmoor. He
knew that with all the sun-glare of that season,
and the water doubtless running a great deal
too fine, he would be as likely to catch trout
on Dartmoor as on the Thames Embankment;
but he determined to go, and he announced his
determination, and the entire personnel, from
the managers to the sweepers, murmured
privily, 'Thank Heaven!'</p>

<p>The moment came for the illustrious departure.
His electric coup&eacute; stood at his private
door, and his own luggage and Simon Shawn's
luggage&mdash;for Simon never entrusted his master
to other hands&mdash;lay on the roof of the coup&eacute;.
Simon, anxiously looking at his watch, chatted
with the driver. Hugo had been stopped on
emerging from the lift by the chief accountant
concerning some technical question. At
length he came out into the street.</p>

<p>'Shaving it close, aren't we, Simon?' he
remarked, and sprang into the vehicle, and
Simon banged the door and sprang on to the
box, and they seemed to be actually off,
much to the relief of Simon, who wanted a
holiday badly.</p>

<p>But they were not actually off. At that
very instant, as the driver pulled his lever,
Albert Shawn came frantically into the scene
from somewhere, and signalled the driver to
wait. Simon cursed his brother.</p>

<p>'Mr. Hugo,' Albert whispered, as he put
his head into the coup&eacute;.</p>

<p>'Well, my lad?'</p>

<p>'I suppose you've heard? They've turned
up again at the flat. Yes, this morning.'</p>

<p>'Who have turned up again?'</p>

<p>'That's the point, sir. Some of 'em. And
there's been a funeral ordered.'</p>

<p>'A funeral? Whose funeral? From <i>us</i>?</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; but whose&mdash;that's another point.
You see, I've just run along to let you know
how far I've got. Not that you gave me
any instructions. But when I heard of a
funeral&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Is it a man's or a woman's?' Hugo demanded,
thinking to himself: 'I must keep
calm. I must keep calm.'</p>

<p>'Don't know, sir.'</p>

<p>'But surely the order-book&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No order for coffin, sir. Merely the cort&egrave;ge;
day after to-morrow; parties making
their own arrangements at cemetery. Brompton.'</p>

<p>'And did none of the porters see who
arrived at the flat this morning?'</p>

<p>'None of 'em knows enough to be sure,
sir.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Hugo, 'there isn't likely to be
a funeral without a coffin, and no porter could
be blind to a coffin going upstairs.'</p>

<p>'I can't get wind of any coffin, sir.'</p>

<p>'And that's all you've learnt?'</p>

<p>'That's the hang of it, sir&mdash;up to now.
But I can wire you to-night or to-morrow,
with further particulars.'</p>

<p>Hugo glanced at the carriage-clock in front
of him, and thought of the famine of porters
at Waterloo Station in August, and invented
several other plausible excuses for a resolution
which he foresaw that he was about to
arrive at.</p>

<p>'You've made me miss my train,' he said,
pretending to be annoyed.</p>

<p>'Sorry, sir. Simon, the governor isn't
going.'</p>

<p>Simon descended from the box for confirmation,
a fratricide in all but deed.</p>

<p>'Have the luggage taken upstairs,' Hugo
commanded.</p>

<p>He sat for seven hours in the dome, scarcely
moving.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock Albert was announced.</p>

<p>'Coffin just come up, sir,' he said, 'from
railway-station.'</p>

<p>But that was the limit of his news.</p>

<p>Within an hour Hugo went to bed. He
could not sleep; he had known that he could
not sleep. The wild and savage threat of
Louis Ravengar, and the question, 'Which?'
haunted his brain. At one o'clock in the
morning he switched on all the lights, rose
out of bed, and walked aimlessly about the
chamber. Something, some morbid impulse,
prompted him to take up the General Catalogue,
which lay next to a priceless copy of
the 1603 edition of Florio's 'Montaigne.'
There were pages and pages about funerals in
the General Catalogue, and forty fine photographic
specimens of tombstones and monuments.</p>

<p>'Funerals conducted in town or country....
Cremations and embalmments undertaken....
Special stress is laid on the
appearance and efficiency of the attendants,
and on the reverent manner in which they
perform all their duties.... A shell finished
with satin, with robe, etc.... All necessary
service.... A hearse (or open car, as preferred)
and four horses, three mourning
coaches, with two horses each. Coachmen
and attendants in mourning, with gloves.
Superintendent, &pound;38.... Estimates for cremation
on application.... Broken column,
in marble, &pound;70. The same, with less carving,
&pound;48.' And so on, and so on; and at the top
of every page: 'Hugo, Sloane Street, London.
Telegraphic address: "Complete, London."
Hugo, Sloane Street, London. Telegraphic
address: "Complete, London." Hugo&mdash;'</p>

<p>Whom was he going to bury the day after
to-morrow&mdash;he, Hugo, undertaker, with his
reverent attendants of appearance guaranteed
respectable?</p>

<p>The great catalogue slipped to the floor with
a terrible noise, and Simon Shawn sprang out
from his lair, and stopped at the sight of his
master in pyjamas under the full-blazing
electric chandelier.</p>

<p>'All serene,' said Hugo; 'I only dropped
a book. Go to sleep. Perhaps we may reach
Devonshire to-morrow,' he added kindly.</p>

<p>He sympathized with Simon.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>He thought he would take a stroll on the
roof; it might calm his nerves.... Foolishness!
How much wiser to take a sedative!</p>

<p>Then he turned to the Montaigne, and after
he had glanced at various pages, his eye encountered
a sentence in italics: <i>'Wisdome
hath hir excesses, and no lesse need of moderation,
than follie.'</i></p>

<p>'True,' he murmured.</p>

<p>He dressed, and went out.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h2>THE COFFIN</h2>


<p>He was in that mental condition, familiar to
every genuine man of action, in which, though
the mind divides against itself, and there is
an apparently even conflict between two impulses,
the battle is lost and won before it is
fought, and the fight is nothing but a sham
fight. He wandered about the roofs; he
went as far as the restaurant garden, and
turned on all the electric festoons and standards
by the secret switch, and sat down
solitary at a table before an empty glass
which a waiter had forgotten to remove. He
extinguished the lights, wandered back to the
dome, climbed to the topmost gallery, and
saw the moon rising over St. Paul's Cathedral.
He said he would go to bed again at once,
well knowing that he would not go to bed
again at once. He swore that he would conquer
the overmastering impulse, well knowing
that it would conquer him. He cursed, as
men only curse themselves. And then, suddenly,
he yielded, gladly, with relief.</p>

<p>He hastened out, and did not pause till he
reached the balcony of flat No. 7 in the further
quadrangle. He admitted frankly now that
the dominant impulse which controlled his
mind would force him to enter the flat during
that night, by means lawful or unlawful, and
he perceived with satisfaction that the great
French window of the drawing-room was not
quite shut. The blinds, however, had been
carefully lowered, and nothing of the interior
was revealed save the fact that a light burned
within. In the entire quadrangle, round
which, tier above tier, hundreds of people
were silent in sleep or in vigil, this was the
sole illumination. Hugo leaned over the
balcony, and tried to pierce the depths of
the vast pit below, and those thoughts came
to him which come to watchers by night in
the presence of sleeping armies, or on the
high sea. The eternal and insoluble question
troubled and teased him, and would not be
put aside. In imagination, he felt the very
swish of the planet as it whirled through space
with its cargo of pitiful humanity. What,
after all, were life, love, ambition, grief,
death? What, in the incessant march of
suns, could be the value of a few restless
specks of vitality clinging with desperation
to a minor orb?</p>

<p>And then he fancied he could hear a sound
within the flat, and he forgot these transcendental
speculations, and for him the secret of
the universe lay behind the blinds of Francis
Tudor's drawing-room. Yes, he could hear a
sound. It was the distant sound of a man
talking&mdash;loudly, slowly, and distinctly&mdash;but
too far off for him to catch even one word.
He guessed, as he pushed the window a little
wider open, and bent his ear to the aperture,
that the voice must be in a room beyond the
drawing-room. It continued monotonously
for a long time, with little breaks at rare intervals;
it was rather like a parson reading
a sermon in an empty church. Then it
ceased. And there were footsteps, which
approached the window, and retired. He
noticed that the light within the room was
being moved, but it cast no human shadow
on the blind. The light came finally to a
standstill, and then there followed sounds
which Hugo could not diagnose&mdash;short, regular
sounds, broken occasionally by a sharp
clash, as of an instrument falling. And
when these had come to an end, there were
more footsteps&mdash;a precise, quick walking to
and fro, which continued for ages of time.
Lastly, the footsteps receded; something
dropped, not heavily, but rather in a manner
gently subsiding, and a groan (or was it a
moan, a tired suspiration?) wakened in Hugo's
spinal column a curious, strange thrill. Then
silence, complete, definitive, terrifying.</p>

<p>By merely pushing the window against the
blind, he could enter and know the secret of
the universe.</p>

<p>'Why am I doing this?' he asked himself,
while he pushed the window. 'Why have I
done this?' he asked himself, as he stood
within the immense and luxurious room.</p>

<p>He gazed round with a swift and timid
glance, as a man would who expects to see
that which ought not to be seen. To his left
was the fireplace, with a magnificent mirror
over it. On the mantelpiece burned a
movable electric table&mdash;lamp, with twin
branched lights. He observed the silk-covered
cord lying across the mantelpiece
and disappearing over the further edge; by
the side of the lamp was a screwdriver.
Exactly in front of the lamp, on a couple of
trestles such as undertakers use, lay an elm
coffin, its head towards the mantelpiece. At
the opposite end of the room was another
fireplace and another mirror, with the result
that Hugo saw an endless succession of
coffins and corpse-lights, repeated and repeated,
till they were lost in a vague crystal
blur, and by every pair of corpse-lights was a
screwdriver.</p>

<p>He stood moveless, and listened, and could
detect no faintest sound. Across the room
from the principal window there was a doorway
with a heavy porti&egrave;re; not a fold of the
porti&egrave;re stirred. To his right, near the other
window, was a door&mdash;the door by which
Camilla had entered that night a month ago;
it was shut. His glance searched among the
rich confusion of furniture&mdash;fauteuils, occasional
tables, sofas, statuary, vases, cabinets.
He peered into every corner of the silent
chamber, and saw nothing that gave a sign
of life. He even gazed up guiltily at the
decorated ceiling, as though some Freemason's
Eye might be scanning him from above.</p>

<p>The coffin reigned in the room; all else was
subservient to its massive and sinister presence,
and the bright twin-lamps watched over
its majesty with dazzling orbs.</p>

<p>Hugo went near the coffin, stepping on tip-toe
over the thick-piled rugs, and examined
it. There was no name-plate. He looked at
himself in the mirror, and again he murmured
a question: 'Why am I here?' Then he
listened attentively, fearfully. No sound.
His hands travelled to the screwdriver on
the mantelpiece, and then fifty of his hands
picked up fifty screwdrivers. And he listened
once more. No sound.</p>

<p>'I must do it. I must,' he thought.</p>

<p>The next moment he was unscrewing the
screws in the lid of the coffin, and scarcely
had he begun the task when he realized that
what he had heard from the balcony was the
screwing of these same screws. There were
twelve, and some of them were difficult to
start, but in due course he had removed them
all, and they stood in a row on their heads
on the mantelpiece. He listened yet again.
No sound. He had only to push the lid of
the coffin to the left or to the right, or to
lift it up. He spent several seconds in deciding
whether he should push or lift, and
then at length fifty Hugos lifted bodily the
lids of fifty coffins. And after a dreadful
hesitation he lowered his gaze and looked.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Camilla! He had known
always that it would be Camilla.</p>

<p>The pale repose of death only emphasized
the proud and splendid beauty of that head,
with its shut eyes, its mouth firmly closed in
a faint smile, and its glorious hair surrounded
by all the white frippery of the shroud. Here
lay the mortal part of the incomparable
creature who had been coveted by three men
and won by one&mdash;for a few brief days' possession.
Here lay the repository of Ravengar's
secrets, the grave of Hugo's happiness,
the dead mate of Tudor's desire. Here lay
the eternal woman, symbol of all beauty and
all charm, victimized by her own loveliness.
For if she had not been lovely, thought Hugo,
if the curves of her cheek and her nostrils and
the colour of her skin had been ever so slightly
different, the world might have contained one
widower, one ruined heart, and one murderer
the less that night.</p>

<p>He did not doubt, he could not doubt, after
Ravengar's threats, that she had been murdered.
And yet he was not angry then. He
did not feel a great grief. He was conscious
of no sensation save a numbed and desolate
awe. He had not begun to feel. Ledging
the lid crossways on the coffin, he placed his
hand gently upon Camilla's brow. It was
colder than he had expected, and it had the
peculiar hard, inelastic touch of incipient
decay&mdash;that touch which communicates a
shudder even to the most impassive.</p>

<p>'I must go,' he whispered, staring spell-bound
at her face.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find drops of moisture
falling on the shroud. They were his tears,
and yet he had not known that he was
crying.</p>

<p>He hid her again beneath the elm plank,
and, taking the screws one by one from the
mantel-piece, shut her up for ever from any
human gaze. And then, nearly collapsing
under a nervous tension such as he had never
before experienced, he turned to leave the
apartment as he had entered it, like a thief.
But the mystery of the heavy velvet porti&egrave;re
invincibly attracted him. His steps wavered
towards it. He fancied he saw something
dark protruding under the curtain, and he
pulled the curtain aside with a movement
almost hysteric. A man lay extended at full
length on his chest in the passage beyond&mdash;what
Hugo had noticed was his boot.</p>

<p>'Tudor!' he exclaimed, kneeling to examine
the half-concealed face.</p>

<p>At the same moment a figure came quietly
down the passage. Hugo looked up, and
saw a sallow-featured man of about thirty-five
in a tourist suit, with light beard and hair,
and long thin hands.</p>

<p>'What is this?' asked the stranger evenly.
'Who are you?'</p>

<p>'My name is Hugo,' Hugo answered with
assurance. 'I was walking along the balconies,
as I do sometimes at night, and I
heard strange sounds here, and as the window
was open I stepped in and found this. Are
you a friend of Mr. Tudor's?'</p>

<p>The other bent in his turn, and after
examining the prone body said:</p>

<p>'I was. He has no friends now.'</p>

<p>'You mean he is dead?'</p>

<p>'He must have died within the last quarter
of an hour or so.'</p>

<p>'And nothing can be done?'</p>

<p>'Nothing can be done with death!'</p>

<p>'I take it you are a doctor?' said Hugo.</p>

<p>'My name is Darcy,' the other replied.
'Besides being Tudor's friend, I was his
physician.'</p>

<p>'Yet even for a physician,' Hugo pursued,
'it seems to me that you have been able to
decide very quickly that your friend and
patient is dead. I have always understood
that to say with assurance that death has
taken place means a very careful and thorough
examination.'</p>

<p>'You are right,' Darcy agreed, stroking his
short, bright, silky beard. 'There is only
one absolute proof of death.'</p>

<p>'And that is?'</p>

<p>'Putrefaction. Nevertheless, the inquest
will show whether or not I have been in error.'</p>

<p>'There will have to be an inquest?'</p>

<p>'Certainly. In such a case as this no
doctor in his senses would give his certificate
without a post-mortem, and though I am an
enthusiast, I am in my senses, Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>'An enthusiast?'</p>

<p>'Let me explain. My friend Tudor was
suffering from one of the rarest of all maladies&mdash;malignant
disease of the heart. The text-books
will tell you that malignant disease of
the heart has probably never been diagnosed.
It is a disease of which there are no symptoms,
in which the patient generally suffers no pain,
and for which there is no treatment. Nevertheless,
in my enthusiasm, I have diagnosed
in this case that a very considerable extent of
the cardiac wall was affected by epithelioma.
We shall see. Not long since I condemned
Tudor to an early and sudden death&mdash;a death
which might be hastened by circumstances.'</p>

<p>'Poor chap!' Hugo murmured.</p>

<p>The dead man looked so young, artless, and
content.</p>

<p>'Why "poor"?' Darcy turned on him
sharply but coldly. 'Is not a sudden death
the best? Would you not wish it for yourself,
for your friends?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Hugo; 'but when one is dead
one is dead. That's all I meant.'</p>

<p>'I have heard much of you, Mr. Hugo,'
said the other. 'And, if I may be excused a
certain bluntness, it is very obvious that,
though you say little, you are no ordinary
man. Can it be possible that you have lived
so long and so fully and are yet capable of
pitying the dead? Have you not learnt that
it is only <i>they</i> who are happy?' He vaguely
indicated the corpse. 'If you will be so good
as to assist me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Willingly,' said Hugo, who could find
nothing else to say. 'I suppose we must
call the servants?'</p>

<p>'Why call the servants? To begin with,
there is only one here, a somewhat antique
housekeeper. Let her sleep. She has been
through sufficient to-day. Morning will be
time enough for the futile formalities which
civilization has invented to protect itself.
Night, which is the season of death, should
not be disturbed by them.'</p>

<p>'As you think best,' Hugo concurred.</p>

<p>'And now,' Darcy began, in a somewhat
relieved tone, when he had finished his task,
and the remains of Francis Tudor lay decently
covered on a sofa in the drawing-room, that
mortuary chamber, 'will you oblige me by
coming into the study for a while? I am not
in the mood for sleep, and perhaps you are
not. And I will admit frankly that I should
prefer not to be alone at present. Yes,' he
added, with a faint deprecatory smile, 'my
theories about death are thoroughly philosophical,
but one cannot always act up to
one's theories.'</p>

<p>And in the study, at the other end of the
flat, far from the relics of humanity, he began
to roll cigarettes with marvellous swiftness in
his long thin fingers.</p>

<p>Hugo surmised that under his singular and
almost glacial calm the man concealed a temperament
highly nervous and sensitive.</p>

<p>'You do not inquire about the&mdash;the coffin?'
said Darcy at length, when they had smoked
for a few moments in silence.</p>

<p>As a fact, Hugo had determined that, at no
matter what cost to his feelings, he would
not be the first to mention the other
fatality.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, and
each blew out a lance of smoke.</p>

<p>'What did she die of?' Hugo demanded
curtly.</p>

<p>'You are aware, then, who it is?'</p>

<p>'Naturally, I guessed.'</p>

<p>'Ah! she died of typhoid fever. You
knew her?'</p>

<p>'I knew her.'</p>

<p>'Of course; I remember. She was in your
employ. Yes,' he sighed; 'she contracted
typhoid fever in Paris. It's always more or
less endemic there. And what with this hot
summer and their water-supply and their
drainage, it's been more rife than usual lately.
Tudor called me in at once. I am qualified
both in England and France, but I practise
in Paris. It was a fairly ordinary case,
except that she suffered from severe and
persistent headaches at the beginning. But
in typhoid the danger is seldom in the fever;
it is in the complications. She had a h&aelig;morrhage.
I&mdash;I failed. A h&aelig;morrhage in typhoid
is not necessarily fatal, but it often proves so.
She died from exhaustion.'</p>

<p>'I thought,' said Hugo, in a low, unnatural
voice, 'that typhoid marked the patient&mdash;spots
on the face.'</p>

<p>'Not invariably. Oh no; but why do you
say that?'</p>

<p>'I only meant that I hope her face was not
marked.'</p>

<p>'It was not. You mean that you hope her
face was not marked because she was so
beautiful?'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' said Hugo. 'And so Tudor
brought the body over to England for burial?'</p>

<p>'Yes; he insisted on that. And he insisted
on my coming with him. I could not refuse.'</p>

<p>'And now he, too, is gone! Tell me, was
he expecting it&mdash;his own death?'</p>

<p>Darcy lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>'Who can say?' he observed to the ceiling.
'Who can say what premonitions such a man
may not have had?'</p>

<p>'I heard talking before I came into the flat
from the balcony,' said Hugo abruptly. 'It
went on for a long time. Was it you and he?'</p>

<p>'No,' the doctor replied; 'I was in here,
writing.' He pointed to some papers on a
desk. 'I did not even hear him fall.'</p>

<p>'Yet you heard me?'</p>

<p>'No, I didn't. I was just coming to find
out what Tudor was doing when I saw you.'</p>

<p>'It is curious that I heard talking, and
walking about, too.'</p>

<p>'Possibly he was talking to himself. Did
you hear two voices?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps I heard only one.'</p>

<p>'Then no doubt he was talking to himself.
You won't be surprised to learn that he had
been in an excessively emotional condition all
day.... It is all very sad. Only a month
ago, and Tudor was&mdash;but what am I saying?
Who knows what perils and misfortunes he&mdash;they&mdash;may
not have escaped? For my part,
I envy&mdash;yes, I envy Tudor.'</p>

<p>'But not her? You do not envy her? In
your quality of philosophy, you regret <i>her</i>
death?'</p>

<p>'Do not ask me to be consistent,' said the
philosopher, after a long pause.</p>

<p>Hugo rose and approached Darcy.</p>

<p>'Are you acquainted with a man named
Louis Ravengar?' he demanded in a rather
loud tone.</p>

<p>The doctor scanned his face.</p>

<p>'I have heard Tudor mention the name,
but I do not know him.'</p>

<p>'And upon my soul I believe you,' cried
Hugo. 'Nevertheless&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless what?'</p>

<p>Darcy seemed startled. Hugo's strange
outburst was indeed startling.</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing!' Hugo muttered. 'Nothing.'
He walked to the window, which looked out
on Blair Street. The first heralds of the
dawn were in the eastern sky, and the moon
overhead was paling. 'It will be daylight
in a minute,' he said. 'I must go. Come
with me first to the drawing-room, will you?'</p>

<p>And they passed together along the passage
to the drawing-room, where the electric lamp
was still keeping watch. Hugo stood by the
side of the coffin.</p>

<p>'What is it?' Darcy quietly asked.</p>

<p>'Have you ever been in love?' Hugo questioned
him.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Darcy.</p>

<p>'Then I will tell you. You will understand.
I must tell someone. I loved her.'</p>

<p>He touched the elm-wood gently, and hurried
out of the room by the French window.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Four days later Mr. Senior Polycarp called
on Hugo in his central office.</p>

<p>In the meantime the inquest had proved
the correctness of Mr. Darcy's diagnosis.
Francis Tudor was buried, and Francis Tudor's
wife was buried. Hugo, who had accompanied
the funerals disguised as one of his own
'respectful attendants,' saw scarcely anyone.
He had to recover the command of his own
soul, and to adopt some definite attitude
towards the army of suspicions which naturally
had assailed him. Could he believe Darcy?
He decided that he could, and that he must.
Darcy had inspired him with confidence, and
there was no doubt that the man had an extensive
practice in Paris, and was well known
at the British Embassy. Camilla, then, had
really died of typhoid fever on her honeymoon,
and hence Ravengar had not murderously
compassed her death. And people did die of
typhoid fever, and people did die on their
honeymoons.</p>

<p>Either Ravengar's threats had been idle, or
Fate had mercifully robbed him of the opportunity
to execute them. Hugo remembered
that he had begun by regarding the threats as
idle, and that it was only later, in presence of
Camilla's corpse, that he had thought otherwise
of them. So he drove back the army of
suspicions, and settled down to accustom himself
to the eternal companionship of a profound
and irremediable grief.</p>

<p>Then it was that Polycarp called.</p>

<p>'I come to you,' said the white-moustached
solicitor, 'on behalf of my late client, Mr.
Tudor. He made his will after his marriage,
and before starting for Paris, and it contains a
peculiar clause. Mr. Tudor had the flat on a
three years' agreement, renewable at his option
for a further period of two years. Over two
years of the three are expired.'</p>

<p>'That is so,' said Hugo. 'You want to
get rid of the tenancy at once? Well, I
don't mind. I can easily&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No,' Polycarp interrupted him, 'I wish to
give notice of renewal. The will provides that
if the testator should die within two months
of the date of it the flat shall be sealed up
exactly as it stands for twelve months after
his death, and that the estate shall be held
by me, as executor and trustee, for that
period, and then dealt with according to
instructions deposited in the testator's private
safe in the vault which I rent from you in
your Safe Deposit.'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have just sealed up the flat&mdash;doors,
windows, ventilators, everything.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Polycarp, this is impossible.'</p>

<p>'Not at all. It is done.'</p>

<p>'But the reason?'</p>

<p>'I know no more than yourself. As executor,
I have carried out the terms of the
will. I thought that you, as landlord, were
entitled to the information which I have
given you.'</p>

<p>'As landlord,' said Hugo, 'I object. And
I shall demand entrance.'</p>

<p>'On what ground?'</p>

<p>'Under the clause which in all tenancy
agreements gives the landlord the right to
enter at reasonable times in order to inspect
the condition of the premises,' Hugo answered
defiantly to the lawyer.</p>

<p>'I had considered that. But I shall dispute
the right. You may bring an action. What
then? No court will give you leave to force
an entrance. An Englishman's furnished flat,
just as much as his house, is his castle. I
could certainly keep you out for a year.'</p>

<p>'And may I ask why you are so anxious to
keep me out, Mr. Polycarp?'</p>

<p>'I am anxious merely to fulfil my duties.
May I ask why you are so anxious to get in?
Why do you want to thwart the wishes of a
dead man?'</p>

<p>'I could not permit that mystery to remain
for a whole year in the very middle of my
block of flats.'</p>

<p><i>'What mystery?'</i> Polycarp suavely inquired.</p>

<p>During this brief conversation all Hugo's
suspicions had hurriedly returned, and he had
examined them anew and more favourably.
Polycarp? Was it not curious that Polycarp
should be acting for both Ravengar and
Tudor?... Darcy? Were there not very
strange features in the behaviour of this
English doctor who preferred to practise in
Paris?... And the h&aelig;morrhage? And,
lastly, this monstrous, unaccountable, inexplicable
shutting-up of the flat?</p>

<p>He felt already that those empty rooms,
dark, silent, sealed, guarding in some recess
he knew not what dreadful secret, were getting
on his nerves. And was he to suffer for a
year?</p>

<p>'Come, Mr. Hugo,' said Polycarp; 'I may
count on your goodwill?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' Hugo replied&mdash;'I don't
know.'</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h2>SALE</h2>


<p>Strange sights are to be seen in London.</p>

<p>At five minutes to nine a.m. on the first day
of the year seven vast crowds stood before the
seven principal entrances to Hugo's; seven
crowds of immortal souls enclosed in the
bodies of women. They meant to begin the
year well by an honest attempt to get something
for nothing. It was a cold, dank, raw,
and formidable morning; Hugo's tessellated
pavements were covered with moisture, and,
moreover, day had not yet conquered night.
But the seven crowds, growing larger each
moment, recked nothing of these inconveniences.
They waited stolidly, silently, in a
suppressed and dangerous fever, as besiegers
await the signal for an attack. Between the
various entrances, on the three fa&ccedil;ades of the
establishment, ran the long lines of windows
dressed with all the materials for happiness,
and behind these ramparts of materials could
be glimpsed Hugo's assistants moving about
in anxious expectation under the electric
lights, which burned red in the foggy gloom.
Over every portal was a purple warning:
'Beware of pickpockets, male and female.'
No possible male pickpockets, however, were
visible to the eye; perhaps they were disguised
as ladies. The seven crowds wedged
themselves closer and closer, clutched tighter
and tighter their purses, and stared at the
golden commissionaires through the glass
doors with a glance more and more ferocious.
Then suddenly something went off with a
boom; it was the first stroke of the great
Hugo clock under the dome. Six pairs of
double doors opened simultaneously, six pairs
of golden commissionaires were overthrown
like ninepins, and in a fraction of time six
companies of determined and remorseless
women had swept like Prussian cavalry into
the interior of the doomed edifice.</p>

<p>But the seventh crowd was left on the
pavement, for the seventh pair of doors had
not opened. And this was the more extraordinary
in that the seventh crowd was the
largest crowd, and stood before the entrance
nearest to the principal scene of the day's
operations. Instantly the world became
aware that Hugo's management was less
perfect than usual, and people recalled incidents
in his business during the previous four
months which had not been to his credit.
The seventh crowd was staggered, furious,
and homicidal. If glances could have killed
the impassive pair of golden commissionaires
behind the seventh portal, they would certainly
have fallen down dead. If the glass
of the seventh portal had not been set in
small squares of immense thickness, it would
have been shattered to bits, and the stronghold
forced. Many women cried out that
justice had come to an end in England, for
was it not an elementary principle of justice
that all doors should open together? A few
women, more practical, and near the edge of
the enraged horde, slipped away to other
entrances. One woman fainted, but she was
held upright by the press, and as no one paid
the slightest attention to her she rapidly came
to. Then at length a tall gentleman in a
beautiful 
frock-coat was seen to be expostulating sternly with the seventh 
pair of golden commissionaires; the recalcitant doors flew open,
and the beautiful frock-coat was hurled violently against a marble
pillar for its pains.
Just as the seventh regiment was disappearing
to join in the sack and loot, a young
and pretty girl drove up in a hansom, threw
the driver a shilling (which the driver contemplated
with a scorn too deep for words),
and joined the tail of the regiment.</p>

<p>'I knew I should do it,' she said to herself,
'and Alb said I shouldn't.'</p>

<p>In another moment Hugo's was a raging
sea of petticoats. In half an hour the doors
had to be shut and locked, and new crowds
formed on the tessellated pavements; Hugo's
was full.</p>

<p>Hugo's was full!</p>

<p>For three days past Hugo had bought whole
pages of every daily paper in London, in
order to break gently to the public the tremendous
fact that his annual sale would commence
on New Year's Day, and the still more
tremendous fact that it would close on the
third of January. There are only three
genuine annual sales in the Metropolis. One
is Hugo's, another happens in Tottenham
Court Road, and the third&mdash;but why disclose
the situation of the third, since all persons
from Putney to Peckham Rise who are worthy
to know it, know it? Hugo's was naturally
the greatest, the largest, the most exciting,
the most marvellous, the most powerful in its
appeal to the most powerful of human instincts&mdash;the
instinct to get half a crown's
worth of value for two shillings. In earlier
years Hugo had made his annual sale prodigious
and incredible, with no thought of
profit, merely for the pleasure of the affair.
But he found that the more he offered to the
public the more he received from them, and
that it was practically impossible to lose
money by giving things away. This is, of
course, a fundamental axiom of commerce.
And now Hugo's annual sale was to be more
astonishing than ever; some said that he
meant at any cost to efface the memory of
those discreditable incidents before mentioned.
Decidedly, many of the advertised
bargains were remarkable in the highest
degree. There was, for example, the 'fine
silvered fox-stole, with real brush at each
end,' at a guinea. Every woman who can
tell a silvered fox-stole from a cock's-feather
boa is aware that a silvered fox-stole simply
cannot be sold for a guinea. Yet Hugo had
announced that he would sell two thousand
of them at that price, not to mention muffs
to match at the same figure. And there was
the famous 'Incroyable' corset, white coutille,
with wide belted band round hips, double belt
to buckle at sides, cut low&mdash;' Enough!
Further indiscretions of description are not
necessary to show that eighteen and nine is
the lowest price at which a reasonable creature
could hope to obtain the 'Incroyable' corset.
But Hugo's price was twelve and eleven. And
the whole-page advertisements were a solid
blazing mass of such jewels.</p>

<p>The young and pretty girl who had known
that she would 'do it' hastened with assured
steps, and as quickly as the jostling multitudes
would allow, to the fur department.
She was in pursuit of one of the silvered fox-stoles
with real brush at each end. She had
her husband's permission&mdash;nay, his command&mdash;to
purchase a silvered fox-stole at a guinea&mdash;if
she could. On the way to her goal she
encountered by chance Simon Shawn, and it
occurred that a temporary block compelled
her to halt before him. The two gazed at
each other, and Simon looked away, flushing.
It was plain that, though acquainted, they
were not on speaking terms. The fact was,
that their silence covered a domestic drama&mdash;a
drama which had arisen as the consequence
of a great human truth&mdash;namely, that
even detectives will marry.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that on a certain
morning in July, after Hugo had finished
pasting a notice on a mirror in one of the
common rooms, in the presence of a pink-aproned
waitress, Albert Shawn entered, and
kissed the pink-aproned waitress. So far as
possible, whom Albert Shawn kissed he
married, and he had married the waitress
just the week before Christmas, and this was
she. Simon had objected sternly to the
<i>m&eacute;salliance</i>. It seemed shocking to Simon
that a rising detective should marry a girl
who waited on shop-girls. Hence the drama.
Hugo had positively refused to allow an open
quarrel between the brothers, because of its
inconvenience to himself, but he could not
prevent a quarrel between Simon and Lily&mdash;such
was her name. They met now for the
first time since the marriage, and Lily's
demeanour may be imagined. She gazed
through Simon as though he did not exist,
and passed magnificently onwards as soon as
the throng permitted. She was Mrs. Albert
Shawn, as neat as ninepence, as smart and
pert as a French maid out for the day. She
drove in hansoms, and she had a five-pound
note in her pocket.</p>

<p>Albert had been granted two weeks' vacation
for his honeymoon, and he ought to have
resumed his duties of detection that morning.
The honeymoon, however, had lasted only
nine days, and the remaining five days of the
period had been spent by him in some secret
affair of his own, an affair which had ended
in an accident to his left foot, so that he
could not walk. The consequence was that,
on this day of all days, Hugo's was deprived
of his services. Lily was, perhaps, not altogether
sorry for the catastrophe which kept
him a prisoner in the nest-like home in Radipole
Road, for it had resulted in this excursion
of hers to the sale. Albert had bidden
her to go to buy a stole and other things, to
keep her eyes open, and to report to Hugo
in person if she observed anything queer.
He had even given her a pass which would
ensure her immediate admittance to any of
Hugo's private lairs. Therefore, Lily felt
extremely important, extremely like a detective's
wife. She knew that Albert trusted
her, and she was very proud that she had not
asked him any questions concerning a matter
exasperatingly mysterious. Albert had taught
her that a detective's wife should crucify
curiosity.</p>

<p>She fought her way to a counter in the fur
department.</p>

<p>'The guinea stoles?' she inquired from a
shopwalker.</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I beg pardon, miss,' said the shopwalker.</p>

<p>'Madam,' Lily corrected him. 'I want
one of those silvered fox-stoles advertised
at a guinea.'</p>

<p>'You'll probably find them over there,
madam,' said the shopwalker, pointing.</p>

<p>'Aren't you sure?' she asked tartly. 'I
don't want to struggle across there and then
find they're somewhere else.'</p>

<p>The shopwalker turned his back on her.</p>

<p>'Well, I never!' she exclaimed to herself,
and decided that Albert should avenge her.</p>

<p>Then, behind the counter, she saw a girl
whom she used to serve with a glass of milk
every morning.</p>

<p>'Oh, Miss Lawton,' she cried, as an equal
to an equal, 'can you tell me where the stoles
are to be found?'</p>

<p>'Probably over there, Mrs. Shawn,' said
Miss Lawton kindly, nodding the greeting
she had no time to utter.</p>

<p>So Lily got away from the counter, plunged
into a chartless sea of customers, and eventually
emerged in the quarter which had been
indicated.</p>

<p>'All sold out, miss!'</p>

<p>Such was the blunt answer to her demand
for a silvered fox-stole.</p>

<p>'Don't talk to me like that!' said Mrs.
Albert Shawn. 'It isn't above half-past nine
on the first morning of the sale, and you
advertised two thousand of them.'</p>

<p>'Sorry, miss. All sold out,' repeated the
second shopwalker.</p>

<p>'I shall report this to Mr. Hugo. Do you
know who I am? I'm&mdash;'</p>

<p>And the second shopwalker also turned his
back.</p>

<p>Could these things be happening at Hugo's,
at Hugo's, so famous for the courtesy, the
long patience, the indestructible politeness of
its well-paid employ&eacute;s? And could Hugo
have descended to the trickeries of the eleven-pence-halfpenny
draper, who proclaimed non-existent
bargains to lure the unwary into his
shop? Lily might have wondered if she was
not dreaming, but she was far too practical
ever to be in the least doubt as to whether
she was asleep or awake. And now she perceived
that scores of angry women about her
were equally disappointed by the disgraceful
absence of those stoles. The department,
misty, stuffy, and noisy, had the air of being
the scene of an insurrection. One lady was
informing the public generally that she had
demanded a guinea stole at three minutes
past nine, and had been put off with a monstrous
excuse. And then a newspaper reporter
appeared, and began to take notes.
The din increased, though shopwalkers said
less and less, and the chances seemed in
favour of the insurrection becoming a riot.
Other admirable bargains in furs were indubitably
to be had&mdash;muffs, for example&mdash;and
the cashiers were busy; but nothing
could atone for the famine of stoles.</p>

<p>Lily had a suspicion that Albert would have
wished her to report these singular circumstances
to Hugo at once. But she dismissed
the suspicion, because she passionately desired
an 'Incroyable' corset at twelve and
eleven, and she feared lest the corsets might
have vanished as strangely as the stoles. In
ten minutes, breathless, she had reached the
corset department, demanded an 'Incroyable'
of the correct size, and bought it. There was
no dissatisfaction in the corset department.</p>

<p>'Shall we send it, miss?'</p>

<p>'Madam,' said Lily proudly. 'No, I'll
take it.'</p>

<p>'Yes, madam.'</p>

<p>At the cash desk (No. 56) she had to wait
her turn in a disorderly queue before she
could tender the bill and her five-pound note.
Customers pressed round her on all sides as
she put down the note and peered through
the wire network into the interior of the desk.</p>

<p>'Next, please,' said the cashier sharply,
after a moment.</p>

<p>'My change,' demanded Lily.</p>

<p>'You have had it, madam.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Lily, 'I have had it, have I?
Now, none of your nonsense, young man!
Do you know who I am? I'm Mrs. Albert
Shawn.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Randall,' the cashier called out coldly,
and a grave and gigantic shopwalker appeared
who knew not the name of Albert Shawn, and
who firmly told Mrs. Shawn that if she wished
to make a complaint she must make it at the
Central Inquiry Office, ground-floor, Department
1A.</p>

<p>Lily had been brazenly robbed at Hugo's by
an employ&eacute; of Hugo! She was elbowed
away by other women apparently anxious to
be robbed. She wanted to cry, but suddenly
remembering her identity, and her pass to the
presence of Hugo, she threw up her head and
marched off through the crowds.</p>

<p>She had not proceeded twenty yards before
she was stopped by a group of persons round
a policeman&mdash;a policeman obviously called in
from Sloane Street. A stout woman of lady-like
appearance had been arrested on a charge
of attempted pocket-picking. An accusatory
shopwalker charged her, and she replied
warmly that she was Lady Brice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kentucky-Webster),
the American wife of the
well-known philanthropist, and that her carriage
was waiting outside. The policeman
and the shopwalker smiled. It was so easy
to be the wife of a well-known philanthropist,
and in these days all the best pickpockets had
their carriages waiting outside.</p>

<p>'I know this lady by sight,' said Lily.
'She visited the common-rooms last year to
see the arrangements, with Mr. Hugo, and he
called her Lady Brice, and I can tell you he'll
be very angry with you.'</p>

<p>'And who are <i>you</i>, my young friend?'
said the policeman sceptically, and threateningly.</p>

<p>'I'm&mdash;'</p>

<p>The formula proved useless. Lady Brice
(<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kentucky-Webster) was led off in all her
vast speechless, outraged impeccability, and
poor little Lily was glad to escape with her
freedom and the memory of Lady Brice's
grateful bow.</p>

<p>She ran, gliding in and out between the
knots of visitors, until she was stopped by a
pair of doors being suddenly shut and fastened
in her face. The reason for the obstruction
was plain. Those doors admitted to the
blouse department, and the blouse department,
as Lily could see through the diamond
panes, was a surging sea of bargain-hunters,
amid which shopwalkers stood up like light-houses,
while the girls behind the counters
trembled in fear of being washed away. Discipline,
order, management, had ceased to
exist at Hugo's.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shawn turned to seek another route,
but already dozens of women were upon her,
and she could not retire. The crowd of candidates
for admission to the blouse department
swelled till it filled the gallery between
that department and its neighbour. Then
someone cried out for air, and someone else
protested that the doors at the other end of
the short gallery had also been shut. Lily,
whose manifold misfortunes had not quenched
her interest in the 'Incroyable' corset,
opened her parcel, and found that the corset
was not an 'Incroyable' at all, but an inferior
substitute, with no proper belted band, and
of a shape to startle even a Brighton bathing-woman!
The change must have been effected
by the assistant in making up the parcel.</p>

<p>'Well!'</p>

<p>She could say no more, and think no more,
than this 'Well!'</p>

<p>And, moreover, the condition of the packed
gallery soon caused her to forget even the final
swindle of the corset. The air had rapidly
become exhausted. Women clutched at each
other; women rapped frenziedly against the
heavy, glazed doors; women screamed. It
was the Black Hole of Calcutta over again,
and yet no one in the blouse department
seemed to notice the signals of distress. Lily
felt the perspiration on her brow and chin,
and then she knew that she, too, must scream
and clutch; and she cried out, and the pressure
which forced her against the door grew
more and more terrible.... She had dropped
the corset.... She murmured feebly
'Alb&mdash;'.... She began to dream queer
dreams and to see strange lights.... And
then something gave way with a crash, and
she fell forward, and regiments of horses
trampled over her, and at last all living things
receded from her, and she was in the midst of
a great silence. And then even the silence
was gone, and there was nothing.</p>

<p>So ended the first part of Lily's adventures
at Hugo's infamous annual sale.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When she recovered perfect consciousness,
she was in the dome. She knew it was the
dome because Albert had once, at her urgent
request, taken her surreptitiously to see it.
Simon was standing over her, as sympathetic
as the most exigent sister-in-law could wish,
and the great Shawn family feud had expired.</p>

<p>In two minutes she was her intensely practical
self again. In five minutes she had
acquainted Simon with all her experiences;
they were but the complement of what he
himself had witnessed.</p>

<p>The sense of a mysterious calamity over-hanging
Hugo's, and the sense of the shame
which had already disgraced Hugo's, pressed
heavily on both of them. They knew that
only one man could retrieve what had been
lost and avert irreparable disaster. Their
faith in that man was undiminished, and
Simon at least was sure that he had been
victimized by some immense conspiracy.</p>

<p>'Why don't you find Mr. Hugo?' Lily
demanded.</p>

<p>'I've looked everywhere. A letter was
brought up to him about an hour ago, and
he went off instantly.'</p>

<p>'And where's the letter?'</p>

<p>'I expect it's in that drawer, where he
throws all his private letters,' said Simon,
pointing to a drawer in the big writing-table on
the opposite side of the room from the piano.</p>

<p>'Is it locked&mdash;the drawer?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Then open it.'</p>

<p>'It's the governor's private drawer,' said
Simon. 'I've never&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Stuff!' Lily exclaimed, and she opened
the drawer and drew out the topmost letter.</p>

<p>It was on blue paper.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's it,' said Simon. 'The envelope
was blue, I remember.'</p>

<p>'He must be in the Safe Deposit,' said Lily,
perusing the letter with flying glance.</p>

<p>And Simon, at length sufficiently emboldened,
seized the letter and read:</p>

<blockquote><p>'SIR,</p>

<p>'Mr. Polycarp has just been here, and
accidentally left behind him keys of his vault,
including safe of late Mr. Francis Tudor, etc.
In these peculiar circumstances I shall be
glad to know what I am to do.</p>

<p>'Yours respectfully,</p>

<p>'H. BROWN,</p>

<p>'Head Guardian,</p>

<p>'Hugo's Safe Deposit.'</p></blockquote>

<p>'What on earth can Brown be thinking
about?' muttered Simon. 'Hadn't he got
enough gumption to send a messenger after
Mr. Polycarp, without troubling the governor?
He'll catch it.'</p>

<p>'Never mind that,' said Lily sharply.
'Run down to the Safe Deposit. Run,
Simon.'</p>

<p>It was as though a delay of minutes might
mean ruin. Who could say what was even
then happening in the disorganized and
masterless departments?</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h2>SAFE DEPOSIT</h2>


<p>The Safe Deposit at Hugo's was perhaps the
most wonderful of all the departments. Until
Hugo thought of it, and paid a trinity of
European experts to design and devise it,
there had existed no such thing as an absolutely
impregnable asylum for valuables. In
Dakota a strong-room alleged to be impregnable
had been approached underground,
tunnelled, mined, and emptied by thieves
with imagination. In the North of England
a safe, which its inventor had defied the whole
universe of crime to open, had been rifled by
the aid of so simple a dodge as duplicate keys.
Even in Tottenham Court Road a couple of
ingenious persons had burnt a hole in a
guaranteed safe by means of common gas
at three and threepence per thousand cubic
feet. These surprises could not occur at
Hugo's. His Safe Deposit really was what
it pretended to be. All contingencies were
provided for. It was the final retort of
virtue to vice.</p>

<p>You approached it by a door of quite ordinary
appearance (no one cares to be seen
leaving what is obviously a safe deposit),
and you signed your name before entering a
lift. You descended forty feet below the
surface of the earth, gave a password on
emerging from the lift, traversed a corridor,
and at length stood in front of the sole entrance
to the Safe Deposit. A guardian,
when you had signed your name again, unlocked
three unpickable, incombustible, and
gunpowder-proof locks in a massive steel
door, and you were admitted, assuming
always that the hour was between nine and
six. Out of hours and on Saturday after-noons
and on Sundays a time-lock rendered
it utterly impossible for any person whatever
to turn any key in the Safe Deposit.
Once the lock was set, Hugo himself could
not have entered, not even to save the British
Empire from instant destruction, until the
time-lock had run its course.</p>

<p>You found yourself in an electrically lighted
world of passages built in flashing steel, with
floors of steel and ceilings of steel&mdash;a world
where the temperature was always 65&deg;.
Every passage was separated from every
other passage by steel grilles, and at intervals
uniformed and gigantic officials wandered
about with impassive, haughty faces&mdash;faces
that indicated a sublime confidence in the
safety of the multifarious riches committed
to their care. You might have guessed yourself
in the fell grip of the Inquisition. As a
fact, you were in something far more fell.
You were in a vast chamber of steel, and that
chamber was itself enclosed on all sides by
three feet of solid concrete. No thief could
tunnel or mine you without first getting
through the District Railway on the one
hand, or the main drainage system of London
on the other. No thief could rifle you by
means of duplicate keys, for no vault and
no safe could be opened except in the presence
of the head guardian, who possessed
a key without which the renter's key was
useless. No tricks could be played with the
gas, because there was no gas, and the electric
light could only be turned off or on from the
top of the lift-well.</p>

<p>Now, it was a singular thing that when
Simon Shawn, having proved his identity and
his mission at the lift, arrived at the entrance
to the Safe Deposit, he discovered the great
steel door ajar, and no door-guardian in the
leather chair where a door-guardian always
sat. This condition of affairs did not affect
the essential impregnability of any individual
vault or safe, but, nevertheless, it was singular.</p>

<p>Simon walked straight in.</p>

<p>'There's no one at the door,' he said to the
patrol, whom he met in the main passage.
'I want to see Mr. Hugo at once. He's down
here somewhere, or he's been here.'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Shawn,' said the patrol politely;
'I did see Mr. Hugo here about an hour or so
ago. I'll ask Mr. Brown. Will you step into
the waiting-room?'</p>

<p>Half-way along the main corridor was a
large room, whose steel walls were masked by
tapestries, where renters could examine their
treasures on marble tables. It was empty
when Simon went in. The patrol carefully
closed the door on him, and then in a moment
came back to say that Mr. Brown was not in
his office, and had probably gone out to lunch,
the hour being noon.</p>

<p>'Where did you see Mr. Hugo?' Simon
asked, hurrying out of the room in a state of
considerable agitation.</p>

<p>'I saw him just here, sir,' said the patrol,
turning down a short side corridor&mdash;the grille
was unfastened&mdash;and stopping before a door
numbered thirty-nine. 'He was talking to
Mr. Brown, and the door of the vault was
open.'</p>

<p>'That must be Mr. Polycarp's vault,'
Simon observed; and then he started, and
put his ear against the door. 'Listen!' he
exclaimed to the patrol. 'Can't you hear
anything inside?'</p>

<p>And the patrol also put his ear to the steel
face of the door.</p>

<p>'I seem to hear a faint knocking, but it's
that faint as you scarcely <i>can</i> hear it. There!
it's stopped.'</p>

<p>'He is inside,' Shawn whispered.</p>

<p>'Who's inside?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>'It's God help him, then,' said the patrol,
'if he's there long. There's no ventilation,
Mr. Shawn. We'd better telephone for Mr.
Polycarp. The other key will be in the key-safe.
I can get it. But how do you make
out, sir, that Mr. Hugo can be in there? The
vault could only be locked by Mr. Polycarp
and Mr. Brown together, and surely they
couldn't both&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mr. Polycarp left his keys behind by accident.
He had gone before Mr. Hugo came
down.'</p>

<p>'There's been no Mr. Polycarp here this
morning,' said the patrol a minute later.
'I've looked at the signature-book. I thought
it was queer I hadn't seen him. And, what's
more, that isn't Mr. Polycarp's vault at all.
Mr. Polycarp's vault is No. 37. This vault
has been empty for several weeks.'</p>

<p>'Then you have both the keys?' Simon
demanded quickly.</p>

<p>'No, sir. It's very strange. There's only
one key of No. 39 in the key-safe, and it's the
renter's key.'</p>

<p>'Then Mr. Brown must have the other.'</p>

<p>'I expect so. But he ought not to have.
It's against rules,' said the patrol. 'I know
where he takes his lunch. I'll send for
him.'</p>

<p>Simon put his ear again to the face of the
door. The faint knocking had ceased, but
after a few seconds it recommenced.</p>

<p>'And suppose you don't find Mr. Brown?'
he queried, still listening.</p>

<p>'Then that vault can't be opened. But
never you fear, Mr. Shawn. I'll have him
here in three minutes. It's funny as he
should have left anybody in there by accident&mdash;and
Mr. Hugo of all people in this blessed
world....'</p>

<p>The patrol's accents died away as he passed
down the main corridor.</p>

<p>Within the next half-hour Simon, who had
the rare virtue of being honest with himself,
was freely admitting, in the privacy of his
own mind, that the crisis had got beyond his
power to grapple with it, and he had begun
to fear complications more dreadful than he
dared to put into words. For the patrol had
failed to find Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown, head
guardian of the Safe Deposit, had disappeared.
Nor was this all. A renter had come to take
his belongings from a safe in the third side-passage
on the left, and the sub-guardian imprisoned
in that passage could not open the
grille between it and the main corridor. He
had his key, but the key would not turn in
the glittering lock. The renter, too impatient
to wait, had departed very angrily at this
excess of safety. Then it was gradually discovered
that every sub-guardian in every
side-passage was similarly imprisoned. Not
a key in the entire place would turn. The
patrol rushed to the main door. The three
keys had clearly been turned while the door
was opened, and the shot bolts prevented the
door from closing. This explained why the
door was ajar, but it did not explain the
absence of the doorkeeper, who had apparently
followed in the footsteps of his chief,
Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>'The time-lock! Someone must have set
it!' cried the patrol to Shawn, and the two
hastened to the other end of the main corridor,
where the dial of the machine glistened under
an electric lamp.</p>

<p>And all the sub-guardians stirred and
grumbled in their beautiful bright cages like
wrathful lions. No such scene had ever been
known in that Safe Deposit or any other safe
deposit before.</p>

<p>The patrol was right. The dial of the time-lock
showed that it had been set against every
lock, great and small, in the Safe Deposit,
until nine a.m. the next day.</p>

<p>'It's all up!' the patrol said solemnly.</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say nothing can be done
to open that vault till nine to-morrow?'
Simon demanded in despair.</p>

<p>'Nothing. The blooming Czar couldn't
manage it with all his Cossacks! No, nor
Bobs either! This is a Safe Deposit, this is,
and if Mr. Hugo is in that vault, it's Mr. Hugo
as knows it's a Safe Deposit by now.'</p>

<p>A brief silence ensued, and then Simon
said:</p>

<p>'We must telephone to the police. There's
a telephone in the waiting-room, isn't there?'</p>

<p>The patrol admitted that there was, but
his manner hinted a low opinion of the utility
of the police. He stood mute while Simon
Shawn told the telephone receiver what had
occurred in the bowels of the earth beneath
Hugo's.</p>

<p>'Wait a minute,' said the telephone, and
then, after a pause: 'Are you there? I'm
Inspector Winter.'</p>

<p>'That's him as has charge of all the strong-room
cases,' the patrol interjected to Simon.</p>

<p>'I've got Mr. Jack Galpin here, as it
happens,' said the telephone.</p>

<p>'Mr. Jack Galpin?' Simon questioned.</p>

<p>'He's just done eighteen months for an
attempt in Lombard Street,' the patrol explained.
'I've heard of him.'</p>

<p>'I'll come down with him immediately in
a cab,' said the telephone.</p>

<p>When Simon returned to the impregnable
door of Vault 39 he listened in vain for a
sound. Then he knocked with his pen-knife
on the polished steel, and presently there was
an answering signal from within&mdash;a series of
scarcely perceptible irregular taps. It struck
him that the irregularity of the taps formed a
rhythm, and after a few seconds he recognised
the rhythm of the Intermezzo from
'Cavalleria Rusticana,' which he had played
for Hugo that very morning.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the messenger-boy
attached to the department came whistling
into the steel corridors, and delivered to the
patrol a small white packet, which, he said,
Mr. Brown had handed to him with instructions
to hand it to the patrol. He had seen
Mr. Brown in a cab outside the building, and
Mr. Brown had the appearance of being very
ill.</p>

<p>The packet contained the second key of
Vault 39.</p>

<p>'But this'll be no use till to-morrow,' was
the patrol's comment, 'and by then&mdash;'</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h2>MR. GALPIN</h2>


<p>When the patrol and Simon between them
had explained the mysterious and fatal situation
to Mr. Jack Galpin, Mr. Jack Galpin
leaned against one of the marble tables in
the waiting-room, and roared with laughter.</p>

<p>'Well,' observed Mr. Galpin, 'he didn't
have his Safe Deposit built for nothing, anyhow!'</p>

<p>And he laughed again.</p>

<p>'But he's slowly dying in there!' said
Simon.</p>

<p>'Yes, I know,' said Mr. Galpin. 'That's
what makes it such a good joke.'</p>

<p>'I don't see it, sir,' Simon remarked.</p>

<p>'Simply because your sense of humour is a
bit off. What are you?'</p>

<p>'I am Mr. Hugo's man.'</p>

<p>'My respects.'</p>

<p>Mr. Galpin had arrived with Inspector
Winter, and Inspector Winter had introduced
him as knowing more about safes
than any other man in England, or perhaps
in Europe. After the introduction, Inspector
Winter, being pressed for time, had departed.
Mr. Galpin was aged about forty, and looked
like an extremely successful commercial
traveller. No one would have suspected
that he had recently done eighteen months
anywhere but in a first-class hotel; even his
thin hands were white, and if his hair was
a little short&mdash;well, the hair of very many
respectable persons is often a little short.
It appeared that he was under obligations
to Inspector Winter, and anxious to oblige.
The relations between distinguished law-breakers
and distinguished detectives are
frequently such as can only exist between
artists who esteem each other. For the rest,
Mr. Galpin had brought a brown bag.</p>

<p>'You see, the time-lock is placed so
that&mdash;' began the patrol.</p>

<p>'Shut up!' said Mr. Galpin curtly. 'I
know all that. I've got scale-plans of every
Safe Deposit in London, and I decided long
since that this one was too good to try. Of
course, with the aid of the entire staff things
might be a bit easier, but not much&mdash;not
much!' he repeated scornfully. 'If I can
manage a job at all, I can usually manage it
alone, and in spite of the entire staff.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you couldn't burn the door of the
vault with oxy-hydrogen?' Simon suggested.</p>

<p>'Yes, I could,' said Mr. Galpin; 'and with
the brand of steel used here I should get
through about this time to-morrow. I could
blow the bally vault up with gun-cotton in
something under two seconds, but no doubt
your Mr. Hugo would go up with it, and then
the Yard would be angry. No!'</p>

<p>He hummed an air, and strolled out into
the main corridor to stare at the curious dial
of the time-lock.</p>

<p>'Why not blow up the clock of the time-lock?'
ventured the patrol.</p>

<p>'Look here!' said Mr. Galpin, '<i>you</i> ought
to know better than that, even if this other
gent doesn't. Any violence to the clock
automatically jams all the connecting levers.
Stop the clock, and it's all up. Nothing but
unbuilding the whole place would free the
locks after that. And it would be a mighty
smart firm that could unbuild this place
inside a fortnight. No!' he said again. 'No
gammon with the clock&mdash;unless we could
make it go quicker.'</p>

<p>'Then there's nothing,' Simon stammered.</p>

<p>Mr. Galpin gazed at the young man.</p>

<p>'Assuming I do the job, what's the job
worth?' he asked.</p>

<p>'It's worth anything.'</p>

<p>'Is it worth a hundred pounds?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Cash?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I promise it. I will hand you my
savings-bank book if you like.'</p>

<p>'I only ask because I have a sort of a
notion about that clock. It's a pendulum
clock, and you know how fast a clock ticks
when you take the pendulum away, and the
escapement can run free. It does an hour in
about three minutes. Now, if I could get
the pendulum out without alarming the
clock ... it would be nine to-morrow morning
in no time. See?'</p>

<p>'I see that,' said the patrol. 'I see that.
But what I don't see&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Never mind what you don't see,' Mr. Jack
Galpin murmured. 'Bring me my bag out
of there. I may tell you,' he went on to
Simon, 'that I thought of this scheme months
ago, just as a pleasant sort of a fancy, but
quite practical. It's a queer world, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'Here's your bag,' said the patrol.</p>

<p>'Now you two can just go into the waiting-room,
and wait till I call you. Understand?
And tell all these wild beasts round here to
hold their tongues and sit tight. I haven't
got to be disturbed in a job like this....
And it's a hundred pounds if I do it, mister,
no more and no less, eh?'</p>

<p>Within exactly twenty-five minutes Mr.
Galpin entered the waiting-room.</p>

<p>'See that?' he said, holding up a pendulum.
'That's <i>it</i>. You can come and look now.
But I don't invite the public to see my own
private melting process. Not me!'</p>

<p>He had burnt two holes through the half-inch
plate of Bessemer steel in which the
clock was enclosed, and by means of two
pairs of tweezers (which must certainly have
been imitated from the armoury of a dentist)
he had detached the pendulum without
stopping the clock. The hands of the clock
could be plainly seen to move, and its ticking
was furiously rapid.</p>

<p>Mr. Galpin made a calculation on his
dazzling cuff.</p>

<p>'In three-quarters of an hour the clock
will have run out,' he informed his audience,
'and you will be able to open any locks that
you've got keys for. I shall call to-morrow
morning, young man, for the swag. And
don't you forget that there's only one Jack
Galpin in the world. My address is 205, the
Waterloo Road.'</p>

<p>He left, with his bag.</p>

<p>Simon rushed to Vault 39 to encourage the
captive by continual knocking.</p>

<p>Then the messenger-boy, who had been
despatched to obtain food for the prisoners
behind the various grilles, came back with
the desired food, and with a copy of the
<i>Evening Herald</i>. The back page of the
<i>Herald</i> bore Hugo's immense advertisement.
The front page was also chiefly devoted to
Hugo. It displayed headings such as:
'Shocking Scenes at a Sloane Street Sale,'
'Women Injured,' 'Customers Complain of
Wholesale Swindling,' 'Scandalous Mismanagement,'
'The Hugo Safe Deposit Suddenly
Closed,' 'Reported Disappearance of Mr.
Hugo,' 'Is He a Lunatic?'</p>

<p>And when the three-quarters of an hour
had expired Simon and the patrol unlocked
the massive portal of Vault 39, and swung
it open, fearful of what they might see within.
And Hugo, pale and feeble, but alive, staggered
heavily forward, and put a hand on
Simon's shoulder.</p>

<p>'Let us get away from this,' he whispered,
as if in profound mental agony.</p>

<p>Ignoring everything, he passed out of the
impregnable Safe Deposit, with its flashing
steel walls, on Simon's obedient arm.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h2>TEA</h2>


<p>Arrived on the ground-floor, Simon managed
to avoid the busy parts of the establishment,
but he happened to choose a way to Hugo's
private lift which led past the service-door
of the Hugo Grand Central Restaurant.
And Hugo, although apparently in a sort
of torpor, noticed it.</p>

<p>'Tea!' he ejaculated. 'If I could have
some at once!'</p>

<p>And he directed Simon into the restaurant,
and so came plump upon one of the worst
scenes in the entire place. The first day of
the great annual sale was closing in almost a
riot, and there in the restaurant the primeval
and savage instincts of the vast, angry crowd
were naturally to be seen in their crudest
form. The famous walnut buffet, eighty feet
in length, was besieged by an army of customers,
chiefly women, who were competing
for food in a manner which ignored even the
rudiments of politeness. It would be difficult
to deny that several scores of well-dressed
ladies, robbed of their self-possession
and their lunch by delays and vexations and
impositions in the departments, were actually
fighting for food. The girls behind the buffet
remained nobly at their posts, but the situation
had outgrown their experience. Every
now and then a crash of crockery or crystal
was heard over the din of shrill voices, and
occasionally a loud protest. Away from the
buffet, on the fine floor of the restaurant, a
few waitresses hurried distracted and aimless
between the tables at which sat irate and
scandalized persons who firmly believed themselves
to be dying of hunger. A number of
people were most obviously stealing food, not
merely from the sideboards, but from their
fellows. At a table near to the corner in
which Hugo, shocked by the spectacle, had
fallen limp into a chair, was seated an old,
fierce man, who looked like a retired Indian
judge, and who had somehow secured a cup
of tea all to himself. A pretty young woman
approached him, and deliberately snatched
the cup from under his very nose&mdash;and without
spilling a drop. The Indian judge sprang
up, roared 'Hussy!' and knocked the table
over with a prodigious racket, then proceeded
to pick the table up again.</p>

<p>'Is it like this everywhere?' asked Hugo
of Shawn.</p>

<p>And Shawn nodded.</p>

<p>'I might have foreseen,' Hugo murmured.</p>

<p>'I'll try to get you some tea, sir,' Shawn
said, with an attempt to be cheerful.</p>

<p>'Don't leave me,' begged Hugo, like a sick
child. 'Don't leave me.'</p>

<p>'Only for a moment, sir,' said Shawn, departing.</p>

<p>Hugo felt that he was about to swoon, that
he had suffered just as much as a man could
suffer, and that Fate was dropping the last
straw on the camel's back. His head fell
forward. He was beaten for that day by
too many mysteries and too many tortures.
And then he observed that the pretty young
woman who had stolen the cup of tea from
the Indian judge was hastening towards him
with the cup of tea in one hand and several
pieces of bread-and-butter in the other.</p>

<p>'Drink this, Mr. Hugo,' she whispered,
standing over him. He hesitated. <i>'Drink
it, I say, or must I throw it over you?'</i></p>

<p>He sipped, and sipped again, obediently.</p>

<p>'Good, isn't it?' she questioned.</p>

<p>He looked up at her. He was stronger
already.</p>

<p>'It's very good,' he said, with conviction.
'Now a bit of bread-and-butter. Thanks.'
Yes, the excellence and power of the Hugo
tea was not to be denied, and he was deeply
glad in that moment that he owned his
private plantations in Ceylon. 'Who are
you, may I ask?' he demanded of his rescuer.</p>

<p>'If you please, sir, I'm Albert's wife.'</p>

<p>'Albert?'</p>

<p>'Albert Shawn, your detective, sir.'</p>

<p>'Of course you are!'</p>

<p>'You gave us a bedroom suite for a wedding
present, sir.'</p>

<p>'Of course I did! By the way, where's
Albert?'</p>

<p>'He's had an accident to his foot, and
couldn't come to-day. You're less pale than
you were, sir. Take this other piece.'</p>

<p>Then Simon returned, empty-handed, and
Lily's eye indicated to him her real opinion
of the value of a male in a crisis. She asked
no questions concerning the events which had
ended in Hugo's collapse. She merely dealt
with the collapse, and in the intervals of
dealing with it she explained to Simon how
she had waited and waited in the dome, and
then descended and tried in vain to enter the
Safe Deposit, and been insulted by the messenger-boy,
and had finally drifted to the
restaurant, where she had caught sight of
Hugo and himself, and guessed immediately
that something in the highest degree unusual
had occurred.</p>

<p>'Come,' said Hugo at last, in curt command,
'I am better.'</p>

<p>He had recovered. He was Hugo again.
And Simon was once more nothing but his body
servant, and Lily nothing but an ex-waitress
who had married rather well. He thanked
Lily, and told her to go and look after her
husband as well as she had looked after him.</p>

<p>In the dome Simon ventured to show him
the <i>Evening Herald</i>. And, having read it,
Hugo nodded his head and pressed his lips
together. He had ordered champagne and
sandwiches, and was consuming them, at the
same time opening a series of yellow envelopes
which lay on a table. These latter were
reports from his detective corps, which had
accumulated during the day.</p>

<p>'Get a sheet of plain paper,' he said to
Simon, 'and write this letter. Are you
ready? Yes, it will do in pencil; I even
prefer it in pencil.</p>

<blockquote><p>'"DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>'"I have reason to think that you
may be interested in some extraordinary
information which I have in my possession
concerning Camilla Tudor, who is supposed
to have been buried at Brompton Cemetery
in July last year. If I am right, perhaps you
will accompany the bearer to my rooms. At
present I will not disclose my name.</p>

<p>'"Yours, etc."</p></blockquote>


<p>'Put any initials you like. Address it to
Louis Ravengar, Esquire. Now listen to me.
Go down to the auto garage, and choose a
good man to take the note instantly; a second
man must go with him. If they bring back
Ravengar, he is to be taken to No. 6, Blair
Street, shown upstairs, and brought along the
bridge-passage into the building. It will be
quite dark, and he will never guess. If necessary,
he must be brought to me by force,
once he is inside. Have two or three porters
in attendance to see to that. But if it's
managed properly, he'll come without a suspicion,
and he'll be finely surprised when he
finds that the long passage ends in just this
room. Come back to me as soon as you've
attended to that.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said Simon, quite mystified, but
none the less enchanted to see Hugo so
actively the old Hugo.</p>

<p>In ten minutes he had returned, and was
beginning to relate new facts which he had
learnt while downstairs.</p>

<p>'Stop!' said Hugo. 'Don't worry me with
needless details. I know enough. And don't
ask me any questions. We can't hope to
remedy the state of affairs to-day. Nevertheless,
we can do something for to-morrow.
I must have Mr. Bentley, the drapery manager,
brought here before six o'clock. He must be
found.'</p>

<p>'He is found, sir. He has shot himself in
his house in Pimlico Road.'</p>

<p>Hugo started.</p>

<p>'Ah!' was all he said at first. He added
dryly: 'Good! And Brown?'</p>

<p>'I have no news of him, sir. He's vanished.'</p>

<p>'Telephone down to the press department
that Mr. Aked must come up to see me at
seven o'clock precisely, and, in the meantime,
he must secure an extra half-page in all
to-morrow's papers.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'And after closing-time the entire staff
must assemble, the men in the carpet-rooms,
and the women in the central restaurant&mdash;or
what's left of it. I shall speak to them.
Have notices put in the common-rooms.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'And send me all the buyers from the
drapery department. They must go round
and buy every silvered fox-stole in London
to-night, at no matter what price.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir.'</p>

<p>'And telephone to Y.Z. that I shall be
down there as soon as I can about these
things.'</p>

<p>He touched the pile of yellow envelopes.
Y.Z. was the name always given to the
detectives' private room.</p>

<p>'Precisely, sir.'</p>

<p>'That's all.'</p>

<p>Simon Shawn gathered that his master had
a very definite clue to the origin of the unique
and fatal events of that day, and that all
dark places were about to be made light
with a blinding light.</p>

<h2>RAVENGAR IN CAPTIVITY</h2>


<p>'Ravengar, what a fool you are!'</p>

<p>The dome was in darkness. Hugo, who
stood concealed near the switch, turned on
all the lights as soon as he had uttered this
singular greeting, and stepped forward. He
had decided to kill Ravengar. The desire to
murder was in his heart, and in order to give
all his instincts full play he had chosen a
theatrical method of welcoming his victim
into the fastness from which he was never
to escape.</p>

<p>'D&mdash;n!' exclaimed Ravengar, evidently
astounded to the uttermost to find himself in
Hugo's dome, and in the presence of Hugo.</p>

<p>He sprang back to the door of the dressing-room
by which he had so unsuspectingly
entered.</p>

<p>'What a fool you are to fall into a trap so
simple! No; don't try to get away. You
can't. That door is locked now. And, moreover,
I have a revolver here, and also a pair
of handcuffs, which I shall use if I have any
trouble with you.'</p>

<p>Ravengar gazed at his captor, irresolute.
His clean-shaven upper lip seemed longer
than ever, and his short gray beard and gray
locks gave him an appearance of sanctimony
which not even his sinister eyes could destroy.
Then he sat down on a chair.</p>

<p>'I should like to know&mdash;' he began,
trying to speak steadily.</p>

<p>'You would like to know,' Hugo took him
up, 'why I am here alive, instead of being
in that vault, suffocated. It was a pretty
dodge of yours to get me down there. You
counted on my curiosity about the Tudor
mystery. You felt sure I should yield to
the temptation. And I did yield. You were
right. I was prepared to commit a breach
of faith in order to satisfy that curiosity.
No sooner was the door closed on me by that
scoundrel Brown, and I found the vault not
Polycarp's vault at all, than I knew to a
certainty that you were at the bottom of the
affair. So easy to make out afterwards that
it was an accident! So easy to spirit Brown
away! So easy to explain everything! Why,
Ravengar, you intended to murder me! I
saw the whole scheme in a flash. You have
corrupted many of my servants to-day. But
you didn't corrupt all of them. And because
you didn't, because you couldn't, I am alive.
You would like to know how I got out. But
you will never know, Ravengar. You will
die without knowing.'</p>

<p>Ravengar put his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>'I can only assume that you are going
mad, Owen,' said he. 'I have long guessed
that you were. Nothing else will explain
this extraordinary action of yours towards
me.'</p>

<p>'You act well,' replied Hugo, sitting down
and eyeing Ravengar critically. 'You act
well. But you gave the whole show away by
the tone in which you swore two minutes ago.
If there is anyone mad in this room, it is yourself.
Your schemes show that queer mixture
of amazing ingenuity and amazing folly which
is characteristic of madmen. Let us hope you
are mad, at any rate.'</p>

<p>'My schemes!' sneered Ravengar. 'You
might at least tell the madman what his
schemes are.'</p>

<p>Hugo laughed.</p>

<p>'You must have been maturing the day's
business quite a long time, my boyhood's
companion, my floater of public companies,
my pearl of financiers. Yes, decidedly parts
of it were wonderfully ingenious. To sow
the place with pickpockets, to get at my
cashiers, my commissionaires, and my servers.
To substitute your own false shopwalkers for
the genuine article. To arrange for the arrest
of important customers on preposterous
charges of theft. To lock up a hundred
women in a gallery till they nearly died.
To have my best and most advertised bargains
removed in the night. To deprive the
restaurants of food, and to employ women
to turn them upside down. To produce, as
you contrived to do, a general air of pandemonium,
and to ruin the discipline of over
three thousand of the best-trained employ&eacute;s
in England. All this, and much else which
I do not mention, was devilish clever in its
conception, and the execution of it commands
my unqualified admiration. Especially having
regard to the fact that you contrived not to
arouse my suspicions. I may tell you that
certain strange incidents which occurred in
my establishment during the autumn did
indeed lead me vaguely to suspect that you
were at work against me, but you were sufficiently
smart to put me off the track again.
Let me add that until this afternoon I did
not perceive that your purchase of a controlling
share in the <i>Evening Herald</i> was only
a portion of a mightier plan.'</p>

<p>'Really, Owen&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Don't waste your breath in denials. You
will have none at all presently, like Bentley.'</p>

<p>'Bentley?' repeated Ravengar, with a slight
movement.</p>

<p>'Yes; but we will come to Bentley in a few
minutes. I have enlarged to you on your own
cleverness. I must enlarge to you on your
folly. What folly! What was the end of all
this to be, Ravengar? I have tried to put
myself in your place, and to follow your
thoughts. You hate me. You think I robbed
you of a fortune, and that I helped to rob you
of a woman. You wished to buy my business,
and add it to the roll of your companies.
And I deprived you of that triumph. Your
hatred of me grew and grew. Leading a
solitary and narrow life, you allowed it to
develop into a species of monomania. I had
come out on top once too often for your peace
of mind. In your opinion the world was too
small to hold both of us. Accordingly, you
evolved your terrific campaign. My business
was to be seriously damaged. And I was to
be murdered. And then you were to get the
concern cheap from my executors, and to
float me dead since you could not float me
living. What folly, Ravengar! What stupendous
folly! Even if the fanciful and
grotesque scheme had succeeded as far as
my death, it could not have succeeded beyond
that point.'</p>

<p>'I don't know what you are chattering
about, Owen, but you look as if you expected
me to ask, "Why?" Anything to oblige you.
Why?'</p>

<p>'You would have known the reason had
you lived long enough to read the provisions
of my will,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>'I see,' said Ravengar.</p>

<p>'You do,' said Hugo. 'You see, you hear,
you breathe, but Bentley doesn't. Bentley
has killed himself.' (Ravengar started.) 'So
that if you have not my blood on your conscience,
you have his. You tempted him; he
fell ... and he has repented. Admit that
you tempted him!'</p>

<p>Ravengar smiled superiorly. And then
Hugo sprang forward in a sudden overmastering
passion.</p>

<p>'Hate breeds hate,' he cried, 'and I have
learnt from you how to hate. Admit that
you have tried to ruin and to murder me,
or, by G&mdash;! I will kill you sooner than I
intended.'</p>

<p>He had no weapon in his hands; the revolver
was in a drawer; but nevertheless
Ravengar shrank from those menacing hands.</p>

<p>'Look here, Hugo&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Will you admit it? Or shall I have to&mdash;'</p>

<p>Their wills met in a supreme conflict.</p>

<p>'Oh, very well, then,' muttered Ravengar.</p>

<p>The conflict was over.</p>

<p>Hugo returned to his chair.</p>

<p>'Miserable cur!' he exclaimed. 'You were
afraid of me. I knew I could frighten you.
I would have liked to be able to admire something
more than your ingenuity. Ravengar,
I do believe I could have forgiven your
attempt to murder me if it had not included
an attempt to dishonour me at the same time.
There is something simple and grand about a
straightforward murder&mdash;I shall prove to you
soon that I do not always regard murder as a
crime&mdash;but to murder a man amid circumstances
of shame, to finish him off while
making him look a fool&mdash;that is the act of a&mdash;of
a Ravengar.'</p>

<p>Ravengar yawned and glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>'It's nearly my dinner-time,' said he.</p>

<p>Again Hugo sprang forward, and, snatching
at the watch, tore it and the chain from
Ravengar's waistcoat, dashed them to the
floor, and stamped on them. He was amazed,
and he was also delighted, at his own fury.
The lust of destruction had got hold of him.</p>

<p>'Ass!' he murmured, suddenly lowering his
voice. 'Can't you guess what I mean to do?'</p>

<p>'I cannot,' Ravengar stammered.</p>

<p>'I mean to put you to the same test to
which you put me. You arranged that I
should spend twenty-two hours in a vault
without ventilation. At the end of five hours
I was by no means dead. I might have survived
the twenty-two. But, frankly, I don't
fancy I should. And I don't fancy you will.
In fact, I'm convinced that you won't.'</p>

<p>'Indeed!' said Ravengar uncertainly.</p>

<p>'You think this scene is not real,' Hugo
continued. 'You think it can't be real. You
refuse to credit the fact that this time to-morrow
you will be dead. You refuse to
admit to yourself that I am in earnest&mdash;deadly,
fatal earnest.'</p>

<p>'Upon my soul!' Ravengar burst out,
standing, 'I believe you are.'</p>

<p>'Good,' said Hugo. 'You are waking up,
positively. You are getting accustomed to
the unpleasant prospect of not dying in your
bed surrounded by inconsolable dependants.'</p>

<p>'Hugo,' Ravengar began persuasively,
'you must be aware that all these suspicions
of yours are a figment of your excited brain.
You must be aware that I never meant to
murder you.'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' Hugo replied with calm
bitterness, '<i>I</i> don't intend to murder <i>you</i>. I
intend merely to put you in that vault. Your
death will be an accidental consequence, as
mine would have been. And why should you
not die? Can you give me a single good
reason why you should continue to live?
What good are you doing on the earth?
Are you making anyone happy? Are you
making yourself happy? That spark of
vitality which constitutes your soul has
chanced on an unfortunate incarnation. Suppose
that I release it, and give it a fresh opportunity,
shall I not be acting worthily? For
you must agree that murder in the strict sense
is an impossible thing. The immortal cannot
die. Vital energy cannot be destroyed. All
that the murderer does is to end one incarnation
and begin another.'</p>

<p>'So that is your theory!'</p>

<p>'Was it not yours, when you got me deposited
in the vault?' Hugo demanded with
ferocious irony. 'I am bound to believe that
it was. The common outcry against murder
(as it is called) can have no weight with enlightened
persons like you and me, Ravengar.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not,' said Ravengar, summoning
his powers of self-control. 'But the common
outcry against murder is apt to be very inconvenient
for the person who chooses, as you
put it, to end one incarnation and begin
another. Has it not struck you, Owen, that
inquiries would be made for me, that my death
would be certain to be discovered, and that
ultimately you would suffer the penalty?'</p>

<p>'My arrangements for the future are far
more complete than yours could have been in
regard to me,' Hugo answered smoothly.
'You betrayed some clumsiness. I shall
profit by your mistakes. No one will see you
go into the Safe Deposit except myself and a
man whom I can trust. No one at all except
myself will see you go into the vault. I can
manage the operation alone. A little chloroform
will quieten you for a time. The vault
once closed will not be opened during my
lifetime, unless at four o'clock to-morrow
night I hear you knocking on the door. Of
course, inquiries will be made, but they will
be futile. People often simply disappear.
You will simply disappear.'</p>

<p>The clock struck six.</p>

<p>'And your conscience?' Ravengar muttered.</p>

<p>'It's soon well under control. Besides, I
shall be doing the human race, and especially
the investing part of the human race, a very
good turn.'</p>

<p>Then Ravengar approached Hugo, and,
Hugo rising to meet him, their faces almost
touched in the middle of the great room.</p>

<p>'You called me a cur,' he said. 'Yet
perhaps I am not such a cur after all. You
have beaten me. You mean to finish me; I
can see it in your face. Well, you will regret
it more than I shall. Do you know I have
often wished to die? You are right in saying
that there is no reason why I should live. I
am only a curse to the world. But you are
wrong to scorn me when you kill me. You
ought to pity me. Did I choose my temperament,
my individuality? As I am, so I was
born, and from his character no man can
escape.'</p>

<p>And he sat down, and Hugo sat down.</p>

<p>'When is it to be?' Ravengar questioned.</p>

<p>'In a few minutes,' said Hugo impassively,
feeding his mortal resentment on the memory
of those hours when he himself had waited
for death in the vault.</p>

<p>'Then I shall have time to ask you how you
came to know that Camilla Payne, or rather
Camilla Tudor, is alive.'</p>

<p>'She is not alive,' Hugo explained. 'The
suggestion contained in my decoy letter was
a pure invention in order to entice you. As
you tempted me into the vault, so I tempted
you here on your way to the vault.'</p>

<p>'But she is alive all the same!' Ravengar
persisted. 'It is the fact that she is not dead
that makes me less unwilling to die, for a word
from her might send me to a death more
shameful than the one you have so kindly
arranged for me.'</p>

<p>Hugo in that instant admired Ravengar,
and he replied quite gently:</p>

<p>'You are mistaken. Where can you have
got the idea that she is not dead? She is
dead. I myself&mdash;I myself screwed her up in
her coffin.'</p>

<p>The words sounded horrible.</p>

<p>'Then you were in the plot!' Ravengar
cried.</p>

<p>'What plot?'</p>

<p>'The plot to persuade me falsely that she
is dead. Bah! I know more than you think.
I know, for example, that her body is not in
the coffin in Brompton Cemetery. And I am
almost sure that I know where she is hiding.
I should have known beyond doubt before
to-morrow morning. However, what does it
matter now?'</p>

<p>'Not in the coffin?' Hugo whispered, as if
to himself. His whole frame trembled, shook,
and his heart, leaping, defied his intellect.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h2>BURGLARS</h2>


<p>When at eleven o'clock that same winter
night Hugo stood hesitating, with certain
tools and a hooded electric lamp in his hand,
on the balcony in front of the drawing-room
window of Francis Tudor's sealed flat, he
thought what a strange, illogical, and capricious
thing is the human heart.</p>

<p>He knew that Camilla was dead. He had
had the very best and most convincing
evidence of the fact. He knew that Ravengar's
suspicions were without foundation,
utterly wrong-headed; and yet those statements
of his enemy had unsettled him. They
had not unsettled the belief of his intelligence,
but they had unsettled his soul's peace. And
that curiosity to learn the whole truth about
the history of the relations between Francis
Tudor and Camilla, that curiosity which had
slumbered for months, and which had been
so suddenly awakened by Ravengar's lure of
the morning, was now urged into a violent
activity.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Camilla was surely dead.
But supposing that by some incredible chance
she was not dead (lo! the human heart),
could he kill Ravengar? This question had
presented itself to him as he sat in the dome
listening to Ravengar's asseverations that
Camilla lived. And the mere ridiculous,
groundless suspicion that she lived, the mere
fanciful dream that she lived, had quite
changed and softened Hugo's mood. He had
struggled hard to keep his resolution to kill
Ravengar, but it had melted away; he had
fanned the fire of his mortal hatred, but it had
cooled, and at length he had admitted to
himself, angrily, reluctantly, that Ravengar
had escaped the ordeal of the vault. And
this being decided, what could he do with
Ravengar? Retain him under lock and key?
Why? To what end? Such illegal captivities
were not practicable for long in
London. Besides, they were absurd, melodramatic,
and futile. As the moments passed
and the fumes of a murderous intoxication
gradually cleared away, Hugo had regained
his natural, sagacious perspective, and he had
perceived that there was only one thing to do
with Ravengar.</p>

<p>He let Ravengar go. He showed him
politely out.</p>

<p>It was an anti-climax, but the incalculable
and peremptory processes of the heart often
result in an anti-climax.</p>

<p>The night was cold and damp, as the
morning had been, and Hugo shivered, but
not with cold. He shivered in the mere
exciting eagerness of anticipation. He had
chosen the drawing-room window because the
panes were very large. He found it perfectly
simple, by means of the treacled cardboard
which he carried, to force in the pane noiselessly.
He pushed aside the blind, and crept
within the room. So simple was it to violate
the will of a dead man, and the solemnly
affixed seals of his executor! He had arranged
that the pane should be replaced before
dawn, and the new putty darkened to match
the rest. Thus, no trace would remain of the
burglarious entry. No seal on door or window
would have been broken.</p>

<p>He stood upright in the drawing-room,
restored the blind and the heavy curtains to
their positions, and then ventured to press the
button of his lamp. He saw once more the
vast outlines of the room which he had last
seen under such circumstances of woe. The
great pieces of furniture were enveloped in
holland covers, and resembled formless ghosts
in the pale illumination of the lamp. He
shivered again. He was afraid now, with the
fear of the unknown, the forbidden, and the
withheld. Why was he there? What could
he hope to discover?</p>

<p>In answer to these questions, he replied:</p>

<p>'Why did Francis Tudor order that the flat
should be closed? He must have had some
reason. I will find it out. It is essential to
my peace of mind to know. I meant to
commit murder to-day; I have only committed
burglary. I ought to congratulate
myself and sing for joy, instead of feeling
afraid.'</p>

<p>So he reassured his spirit as he stepped carefully
into the midst of the holland-covered
and moveless ghosts. On the mantelpiece to
the left there still stood the electric table-light,
and by its side still lay the screwdriver....
He determined to pass straight through
the drawing-room. At the further edge of
the carpet, on the parquet flooring between the
carpet and the porti&egrave;re leading to the inner
hall, he noticed under the ray of his lamp footprints
in the dust&mdash;footprints of a man, and
smaller footprints, either of a woman or a
child. He remained motionless, staring at
them. Then it occurred to him that during
the days between the death of its tenant and
the sealing-up the flat would probably not
have been cleaned, and that these footprints
must have been made months ago by the last
persons to leave the flat. Little dust would
fall after the closing of the flat. He was glad
that he had thought of that explanation. It
was a convincing explanation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he dared not proceed. For on
the other mantelpiece to the right there was a
clock, and while staring in the ghostly silence
at the footprints, he had fancied that his ear
caught the ticking of the clock. Imagination,
doubtless! But he dared not proceed until
he had satisfied himself that his ears had
deluded him; and, equally, he dared not
approach the clock to satisfy himself. He
could only gaze at the reflection of the clock
in the opposite mirror. In the opposite
mirror the hands indicated half a minute
past nine; hence the clock was really at half
a minute to three, and if it was actually
going, it might be expected to strike immediately.
He waited. He heard a preliminary
grinding noise familiar to students of symptoms
in clocks, and in the fraction of a second
he was bathed from head to foot in a cold
perspiration.</p>

<p>The clock struck three.</p>

<p>The next instant he walked boldly up to
the clock and bent his ear to it. No, he
could hear nothing. It had stopped. He
glared steadily at the hands for two
minutes by his own watch; they did not
move.</p>

<p>In the back of his head, in the small of his
back, in his legs, little tracts of his epidermis
tickled momentarily. He wiped his face, and
walked boldly away from the clock to the
porti&egrave;re, which he lifted with one arm. Then
he threw the light of his lamp direct on the
dial, and glared at it again, fearful lest it
should have taken advantage of his departure
to resume its measuring of eternity.</p>

<p>Could a clock go for four months? A
clock could be made that would go for four
months. But this was not a freak-clock. It
was a large Louis Seize pendule, and he knew
it to be genuine of his own knowledge; he
had bought it.</p>

<p>He dropped the porti&egrave;re between himself
and the clock, and stood in the inner hall.
He had had as much of the drawing-room as
was good for his nerves.</p>

<p>The inner hall was oblong in shape, and
measured about twelve feet at its greatest
width. In front of him, as he stood with his
back to the drawing-room, was a closed door,
which he knew led into the principal bedroom
of the flat. To his right another heavy
porti&egrave;re divided the inner from the outer
hall. This porti&egrave;re hung in straight perpendicular
folds. He wondered why the porti&egrave;res
had not been taken down and folded
away.</p>

<p>He decided to penetrate first into the bedroom,
partly because he deemed the bedroom
might contain the solution of the enigma, and
partly because his eye had fancied it saw a
slight tremor in the porti&egrave;re leading to the
outer hall. So he stepped stoutly across the
space which separated him from the bedroom
door. But he had not reached the door
before there was a loud, sharp explosion, and
a panel of the door splintered and showed
a hole, and he thought he heard a faint
cry.</p>

<p>A revolver shot!</p>

<p>He did not believe in anything so far-fetched
as man-traps and spring-guns. Hence
there must be some person or persons in the
flat. Some unseen intelligence was following
him. Some mysterious will had ordained
that he should not enter that bedroom. The
shot was a warning. He guessed from the
flight of the splinters and the appearance of
the hole that the mysterious will must be on
the other side of the porti&egrave;re, but the porti&egrave;re
gave no sign.</p>

<p>What was he to do? He had brought with
him no weapon. He had not anticipated that
revolvers would be needed in the exploration
of an empty and forbidden flat. The very
definite terrors of the inner hall seemed to
him to surpass the vaguer terrors of the
drawing-room, and he decided to return
thither in order to consider quietly what his
tactics should be; if necessary, he could return
to the dome for arms and assistance. But no
sooner did he move a foot towards the drawing-room
than another shot sounded. The
drawing-room porti&egrave;re trembled, and something
crashed within the apartment. The
mysterious will had ardently decided that he
should go neither back nor forward.</p>

<p>'Who's there? Who's that shooting?'
he muttered thickly, and extinguished his
lamp.</p>

<p>He had meant to cry out loud, but, to
his intense surprise, his throat was dried
up.</p>

<p>There was no answer, no stir, no noise.
The silence that exists between the stars
seemed to close in upon him. Then he really
knew what fear was. He admitted to himself
that he was unmistakably and horribly afraid.
He admitted that life was inconceivably precious,
and the instinct to preserve it the
greatest of all instincts. And gradually he
came to see that the safest course was the
most desperate course, and gradually his
courage triumphed over his fear.</p>

<p>He dropped gently to his hands and knees,
and began, with a thousand precautions, to
crawl like a serpent towards the outer hall.
The darkened lamp he held between his teeth.
If the mysterious will fired again, the mysterious
will would almost to a certainty fire
harmlessly over his head. At last his hands
touched the porti&egrave;re. He hesitated, listened,
and put one hand under the porti&egrave;re. Then,
relighting the lamp, he sprang up with a yell
on the other side of the porti&egrave;re, and clutched
for the unseen intelligence.</p>

<p>But there was nothing. He stood alone in
the outer hall. To his right lay the side-passage
between the drawing-room and the
<i>cabinet de toilette</i>, which Camilla had used on
the night of her engagement. In front of
him was a door, slightly ajar, which led to
the servants' quarters. He gazed around,
breathing heavily.</p>

<h2>POLYCARP AND HAWKE'S MAN</h2>


<p>Then it was that he heard a noise, something
between scratching and fumbling, on the
further side of the front-door, in the main
corridor of the flats. He could see through
the ground glass over the door that the
corridor was lighted as usual.</p>

<p>He thought: 'Someone is breaking the
seal on that door!' And his next idea was:
'Since the seal is being broken in the full
light of the public corridor, it is being broken
by someone who has the right to break it.
Only one man has the right, and that man is
Francis Tudor's executor, Senior Polycarp.'</p>

<p>The noise of scratching and fumbling ceased,
and a key was placed in the lock.</p>

<p>Hugo hastily extinguished his lamp, and
hid behind the porti&egrave;re. Immediately the
lamp was extinguished he observed, what he
had not observed before, that a faint light
came through the aperture of the door leading
to the servants' quarters.</p>

<p>The front-door opened, and he heard footsteps
in the hall. Then ensued a pause. Then
the footsteps advanced, and the newcomer
evidently went into the room where the faint
light was.</p>

<p>'Come out of that!'</p>

<p>Yes; it was Polycarp's quiet, mincing,
imperious voice.</p>

<p>'Come out of it yourself!'</p>

<p>The answering tones were gruff, heavy, full,
the speech of a strong coarse-fibred man.</p>

<p>Hugo peeped cautiously through the porti&egrave;re.
Polycarp was backing slowly out of
the room into the hall, followed by a tall,
dark, scowling man, who bore an ordinary
kitchen candle. Polycarp halted in the middle
of the floor. The man also halted; he seemed
to be towering over Polycarp in an attitude
of menace.</p>

<p>'Let me pass,' said the man. 'I've had
enough of this.'</p>

<p>Polycarp smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>'You're caught,' said he. 'You're one of
Hawke's men, aren't you?'</p>

<p>'Go to h&mdash;!' was the man's ferocious
reply.</p>

<p>'Answer my question, sir.'</p>

<p>'What if I am?' the man grumbled.</p>

<p>'In five minutes you'll be in the hands of
the police. I got wind yesterday of what
your rascally agency was up to. You needn't
deny anything. You're working on behalf of
Mr. Ravengar. You know me! Mr. Ravengar
happens to be a client of mine, but after
to-night he will be so no longer. What he
wants done in this flat I cannot guess, but it's
an absolute certainty that you're in for three
years' penal, my friend.'</p>

<p>'Let me pass,' the man repeated, lifting his
jaw, 'or I'll blow your brains out!'</p>

<p>He produced his revolver.</p>

<p>'Oh no, you won't,' said Polycarp coldly.
'You daren't. You aren't on the stage, and
you aren't in Texas. And you aren't a bold
Bret Harte villain. You're simply the creature
of a private inquiry agency, as it's called,
the most miserable of trades! Usually you
spend your time in manufacturing divorces,
but just now you're doing something more
dangerous even than that, something that
needed more pluck than you've got. I should
advise you to come with me quietly.'</p>

<p>Polycarp was in evening dress, and carried
a pair of white gloves. Hugo decidedly admired
the old dandy as he stood there gazing
up so condescendingly at the man with the
candle.</p>

<p>'Look here!' said the man with the candle.
'Let me pass. I don't want any fuss. I
want to go. There's more in this flat than
I bargained for. Let me pass.'</p>

<p>'Give me that revolver,' Polycarp smoothly
demanded.</p>

<p>'Curse it!' cried the man. 'I'll give it
you! Hands up, you old fool! Do you
think I'm here for fun?'</p>

<p>And he raised the revolver.</p>

<p>'I shall not put my hands up.'</p>

<p>'I'll count five,' said the man grimly, 'and
if you don't&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Count.'</p>

<p>'One!... two!... three! Can't you
see I mean it?'</p>

<p>Hugo perceived plainly the murderous, wild
look on the man's face. He knew what it was
to feel murderous. He knew that in a fit of
homicide all considerations of prudence, all
care for the future, vanish away, that the
mind is utterly monopolized by the obsession
of the one single desire.</p>

<p>Polycarp disdainfully sneered:</p>

<p>'Four!'</p>

<p>Hugo could withstand the strain no more.
He bounded out from his concealment, and
snatched the revolver from the man's hand.</p>

<p>'I forgot you,' growled the man, glancing
at him, disgusted.</p>

<p>And so saying he dashed the candle in
Polycarp's face and knocked him violently
against Hugo. Both Hugo and Polycarp fell
to the ground. The man made a leap for the
door, and in a second had fled, banging it
after him. Hugo and Polycarp rose with stiff
movements. Hugo picked up his lamp, and
the two confronted each other. It was a
highly delicate situation.</p>

<p>'Your life is, at any rate, saved,' said Hugo
at length.</p>

<p>'You think it was in danger?'</p>

<p>Polycarp's lip curled.</p>

<p>'I think so.'</p>

<p>'Possibly you foresaw the danger I ran,'
Polycarp remarked with frigid irony, 'and
came into the flat with the intention of protecting
me. May I ask <i>how</i> you came in?'</p>

<p>'I came in through the drawing-room
window,' said Hugo. 'I did not interfere
with your seals, however,' he added.</p>

<p>'You know you are guilty of a criminal
offence?'</p>

<p>'I know it.'</p>

<p>'And that I, as executor of the late Francis
Tudor, have a duty which I must perform, no
matter how unpleasant both for you and for
me?'</p>

<p>'Just so.'</p>

<p>'What are you doing here? Do you
think your conduct is worthy of a gentleman?'</p>

<p>Hugo put the candle down on a table, and
dug his hands into his pockets.</p>

<p>'At this moment,' said he, 'I am not a
gentleman. I am just a man. Nothing else.
I will appeal to you as another man. I need
hardly say that I have no connection with the
opposition firm; I was entirely ignorant of the
presence of Hawke's mission here when I broke
into the flat. I had no notion that Ravengar
was pursuing investigations similar to mine.
Mr. Polycarp, Ravengar is, or was, a client
of yours&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Was.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I heard what you said a few moments
ago. Was a client of yours. I am sure,
therefore, that no one knows better than you
that Ravengar is not an honest man. On the
other hand, I am equally sure that on the few
occasions when you and I have met I must
have impressed you as a comparatively honest
man. Is it not so? I speak without false
modesty. Is it not so?'</p>

<p>Polycarp nodded.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' proceeded Hugo, walking
slowly about, 'you will probably need no
convincing that in any difficulty between me
and Ravengar I am in the right. Now, there
have been, and are, matters between Ravengar
and me in which others had best not
interfere, even indirectly. I shall end those
matters in my own way, because I am the
strongest, and because my hands are clean.
I can give you no details. But let me tell
you that once the whole of my life's dream
was in this flat, this flat which you have
legally closed, and I have illegally opened.
Let me tell you that my life, the only part
of my life for which I cared, came to an end
in this flat some months ago: and that a
mystery hangs over that event which has
lately made intolerable even the dead-alive
existence which Fate had left to me. Let
me tell you that circumstances have arisen
this very day which rendered it impossible
for me to keep myself out of this flat, be the
penalty what it might. And, finally, let me
make my appeal to you.'</p>

<p>'What do you want?' asked Polycarp
quietly. The sincerity of Hugo's emotion
had touched him. 'Don't ask me to act
contrary to my duty.'</p>

<p>'But that is just what I shall ask!' Hugo
exclaimed. 'Leave me. Leave me till to-morrow:
that is my sole wish. What is your
duty, after all? Tudor is dead. He is
beyond the reach of harm. He requires the
protection of no lawyer. Trust me, and leave
me. I am an honest man. Forget your law,
forget your parchments, forget the conventions
of society, forget everything except that
you are human, and can do a service to a
fellow-creature. Exercise some imagination,
and see how artificial and absurd is the world
of ideas in which you live. Listen to your
heart, and help me. I am worth it. Can't
you see how I suffer? To-day I have been
through as much as I can stand. I am at the
end of my forces, and I must have sympathy.
You will be guilty of deliberate neglect of
duty in leaving me here, but I implore you
to leave me. And I give no specific reason
why you should. Will you?'</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Polycarp.</p>

<p>'I thank you.'</p>

<p>'I don't know why I should consent,' Polycarp
continued, 'but I do. I am quite in the
dark. Legally, I am a disgrace to my profession.
I forfeit my professional honour.
But I will consent. Do what you like. Go
out as you came in and leave no trace. If,
however&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Don't trouble to say that,' Hugo interrupted
him. 'I shall take no unfair advantage
of your generosity. The flat and all its
contents are absolutely safe in my hands.
And if you should decide, in the future, that
I must accept the consequences of to-night's
work, I shall not shuffle. All I want is to be
left alone <i>now</i>.'</p>

<p>Polycarp opened the door.</p>

<p>'Good-night,' he said. 'Perhaps you did
save my life. But if you had appealed on
that account to my gratitude I should have
been obliged to refuse your request.'</p>

<p>'I know it,' said Hugo. 'I knew whom I
was talking to. Good-night, and thanks.'</p>

<p>'I shall lock this door,' Polycarp called out,
departing.</p>

<p>'Yes, do; and, I say, you'll lay hands on
that man of Hawke's easily enough in a day
or two.'</p>

<p>'Oh, certainly,' said Polycarp. 'I have
not forgotten him. But I was compelled to
deal with you first.'</p>

<p>Twisting his white moustache, and buttoning
his overcoat across the vast acreage of
his shirt-front, Polycarp disappeared from
Hugo's view into the corridor.</p>

<h2>HUSBAND AND WIFE</h2>


<p>Hugo bolted the front-door on the inside,
relighted the candle which Hawke's man had
used as a weapon, and placed it in the middle
of the hall floor. He then penetrated into
the servants' part of the flat, and emerged
on to the balcony by the small side-door,
which was open, and had evidently been
forced by Hawke's man. And there, on the
balcony, he leaned over the balustrade in the
cold humid night, and tried to recover his
calmness. He felt that any systematic,
scientific search of the premises would be
impossible to him until his mind resembled
somewhat less a sea across which a hurricane
has just passed.</p>

<p>Many questions stood ready to puzzle his
brain, but he ignored them all, and fell into
a vague reverie, of which Camilla was the
centre. And from this reverie he was suddenly
startled by the clear, unmistakable
sound of a door being shut within the flat.
It was not the shutting of a door by the
wind, but the careful, precise shutting of a
door by some person who had a habit of
shutting doors as doors ought to be shut.</p>

<p>'Polycarp has returned!' was his first
thought. But he remembered. 'No! I
bolted the front-door on the inside.'</p>

<p>The conundrum of the clock and of the two
sizes of footprints in the drawing-room recurred
to him. Without allowing himself to
hesitate, he strode back again into the flat,
with a sort of unbreathed sigh, an unuttered
complaint against circumstances for not giving
him an instant's peace.</p>

<p>The candle was still placidly burning in the
hall, but its position had certainly been
shifted by at least three feet. It was much
nearer the porti&egrave;re leading to the inner hall.
Hugo listened intently. Not a sound! And
he stared interrogatively at the candle as
though the candle were a guilty thing.</p>

<p>However, he now possessed the revolver
of Hawke's man, and this gave him confidence.
He left the perambulating candle to
itself, and proceeded to the inner hall by the
light of his own electric lamp. The door of
the principal bedroom, which he had originally
meant to invade, lay to his right; the entrance
to the drawing-room lay to his left. He
thought he would take another look at the
drawing-room, and then he thought:</p>

<p>'No; I'll tackle the bedroom.'</p>

<p>And he seized the handle of the bedroom
door. At the first trial it would not turn,
but in a moment it turned a little, and then
turned back against his pressure.</p>

<p>'Someone's got hold of it inside!' he said
to himself.</p>

<p>He put the lamp on a chair, and took the
revolver from his pocket in readiness for any
complications that might follow his forcing
of the door.</p>

<p>Then he heard a woman's voice within the
bedroom.</p>

<p>'I shall open it, Alb, if you kill me for it.
I don't care who it is. You may be dying
of loss of blood. In fact, I'm sure you are.'</p>

<p>And the door was pulled wide open with a
single sweeping movement, and Hugo beheld
the figure, slightly dishevelled and more than
slightly perturbed, of Mrs. Albert Shawn.</p>

<p>'Oh, Alb!' cried Lily. 'It's Mr. Hugo!
Oh, Mr. Hugo! whatever next will happen in
this world?'</p>

<p>The swift loosing of the tension of Hugo's
nerves was too much for his self-possession.
He burst into a peal of loud laughter. It was
unnaturally loud, it was hysterical; but it
was genuine laughter, and it did him good.</p>

<p>Lily straightened herself. So far, she had
not admitted Hugo into the chamber.</p>

<p>'It's all very well for you to laugh like that,
Mr. Hugo,' she protested sharply; 'but perhaps
you don't know that you've nearly
killed my husband with that there revolver.
The shot came through the door, and took
him in the arm just as he was emptying this
safe.'</p>

<p>Hugo saw Albert Shawn lying on the
stripped bed, a handkerchief tied round his
arm, and in the corner near the door a large
safe opened, and its contents in a heap on
the floor.</p>

<p>'It's all right, sir,' said Albert; 'come in.
I'm nowhere near croaking. I didn't know
you were on this lay as well as me, sir. I
thought I was going to come down on you
to-morrow with a surprise like a thousand of
bricks.'</p>

<p>'What lay, Albert?' asked Hugo, advancing
into the room.</p>

<p>'The secret-finding lay, sir,' said Albert.</p>

<p>'Your wife has the right to be anxious
about you,' Hugo observed, after a pause.
'But you don't seem to be quite dying,
Shawn; and I think it will be as well if
you explain to me why you have adopted
the profession of burglar. It is extremely
singular that there should have been three
burglars here to-night. You, and then
me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What did I tell you, Alb?' Mrs. Albert
Shawn exclaimed. 'Didn't I tell you I
heard a scuffle?'</p>

<p>'The scuffle was between me and No. 3.
And be it known to you, Mrs. Shawn, that
the revolver was not fired by me, but by
No. 3. I took it off him, afterwards.'</p>

<p>'Then No. 3 must have come on behalf of
Mr. Ravengar, sir,' said Albert.</p>

<p>'You are no doubt right,' Hugo agreed.
'But how did you know that?'</p>

<p>'Hawke's Detective Agency, sir. I found
out before my wedding that one of their men
had been hanging about here, so I chummed
up to him. I spun him a yarn how I'd been
with Hawke's once, and they gave me the
bag, and I wasn't satisfied, and he'd got a
lot of grievances against Hawke's, too, he
had. We got very friendly. Pity I had to
leave the thing for my wedding. But I came
back after a week.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that he did, sir,' said Lily proudly,
'and insisted on it.'</p>

<p>'I soon knew they were going to burglarize
this flat to get some phonograph records.'</p>

<p>'Phonograph records!' Hugo repeated, pondering.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; and so I thought I'd be beforehand
with 'em.'</p>

<p>'Why didn't you tell me directly you
knew?'</p>

<p>'You gave me that Gaboriau book to read,
sir, and I learnt a lot from it. It's put me
up to a power of things. And, amongst others,
that two people can't manage one job. One
job, one man.'</p>

<p>'You'll excuse Albert, sir,' said Lily;
'that's only his way of talking.'</p>

<p>'It was simply this, sir. I found out
enough to make me as sure as eggs is eggs
that you'd like to have those phonograph
records yourself, without having to inquire
too much where they came from or how they
came.'</p>

<p>'I see.'</p>

<p>'Exactly, sir. Well, to cut a long story
short, sir, I happened to come across something
yesterday that made me think that the
annual sale was going to be interfered with
by parties unknown. But I'd got all I could
manage, and I left that alone; I'd no time
for it. And last night parties unknown tried
to break my leg for me with an open
cellar-flap. I knew it was a plant, and so I pretended
it had succeeded.'</p>

<p>'He made me think his ankle was that
sprained he couldn't walk. He wouldn't
trust even me, sir,' said Lily.</p>

<p>'Gaboriau,' Albert explained briefly. 'I
knew I was watched, and I told Lily to tell
the milkman I couldn't walk. It was all
over Radipole Road at eight o'clock this
morning. And so, while parties unknown
thought I was fast on a sofa, I slipped out
by the back-door as soon as I'd sent Lily
here to warn you about the annual sale, in
case of necessity. I must say I thought I
should be twenty-four hours in front of
Hawke's men, but I expect they changed
their plans. I brought Lily along with me
at the last moment. She's read Gaboriau,
too, sir, and she's mighty handy.'</p>

<p>'I am aware of it,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>'Anyhow, we got in here first, by the side-door
on the balcony. Hawke's man must
have come in about an hour after us, and
you just after him. That's how I reckon it.'</p>

<p>'You went into the drawing-room, didn't
you?' Hugo asked.</p>

<p>'Just looked in.'</p>

<p>'And played with the clock?'</p>

<p>Here he glanced sternly at Lily.</p>

<p>'I shook it to start it, sir, to see if it would
go,' Lily admitted.</p>

<p>'I reckon you turned out Hawke's man,
sir?' Albert queried.</p>

<p>'It amounted to that,' said Hugo. 'But
these phonograph records&mdash;what are they?'</p>

<p>'I don't know what they are,' said Albert,
descending from the bed, 'but I know that
Mr. Ravengar wanted them very badly. It
seems Mr. Tudor was a great hand at phonographs
and gramophones. Like me, sir.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; we've got a beauty. My uncle
gave it us,' Lily put in. 'Oh, Alb! your
arm's all burst out again.'</p>

<p>The bandage was, in fact, slightly discoloured.</p>

<p>'Oh, that's nothing, my dear,' said Albert.</p>

<p>He pushed up a pile of discs from in front
of the safe, and displayed them to Hugo.</p>

<p>'Can we try them here?' Hugo demanded,
in a voice suddenly and profoundly eager.</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir. Here's the machine. You
undo this catch, and then you&mdash;'</p>

<p>Albert was mounted on his latest hobby,
and in a few minutes, although he could only
use one arm, the phonograph, which stood on
the table near the safe, was ready for its work
of reproduction. Albert started it.</p>

<p>'Follow me, follow me!'</p>

<p>It began to sing the famous ditty in the
famous voice of Miss Edna May.</p>

<p>'Stop that!' cried Hugo, and Albert stopped
it.</p>

<p>The next two discs proved to be respectively
a series of stories of Mr. R.G. Knowles and
'The Lost Chord,' played on a cornet. And
these also were cut short. Then came a
bundle of discs tied together. Hugo himself
fixed the top one, and the machine, after
whirring inarticulately, said in slow, clear
tones:</p>

<p>'In case I should die before&mdash;'</p>

<p>Hugo arrested the action.</p>

<p>'Go,' he said, almost threateningly, to
Albert and his wife. 'Mrs. Shawn, look after
your husband's wound. It needs it. See the
blood!'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Go,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>And they went.</p>

<p>And when they were gone he released the
mechanism, and in the still solitude of the
bedroom listened to the strange story of
Francis Tudor, related in Francis Tudor's
own voice. It occurred to him that the man
must have been talking into a phonograph
shortly before he died. He remembered the
monotonous voice on that fatal night in
August.</p>

<h2>WHAT THE PHONOGRAPH SAID</h2>


<p>In case I should die before I can complete my
arrangements for the future (said the phonograph,
reproducing the voice of Francis
Tudor), I am making a brief statement of the
whole case into this phonograph. I am
exhausted with to-day's work, and I shall find
it easier and much quicker to speak than to
write; and I'm informed that I ought never to
exert myself more than is necessary. Supposing
I were to die within the next few days&mdash;and
I have yet to go through the business
of the funeral ceremonies!&mdash;circumstances
might arise which might nullify part of my
plan, unless a clear account of the affair should
ultimately come into the hands of some person
whom I could trust not to make a fool of
himself&mdash;such as Polycarp, my solicitor, for
instance.</p>

<p>Hence I relate the facts for a private record.</p>

<p>When I first met Camilla Payne she was
shorthand clerk or private secretary, or whatever
you call it, to Louis Ravengar. I saw
her in his office. Curiously, she didn't make
a tremendous impression on me at the
moment. By the way, Polycarp, if it is
indeed you who listen to this, you must excuse
my way of relating the facts. I can only tell
the tale in my own way. Besides meddling
with finance, I've dabbled in pretty nearly all
the arts, including the art of fiction, and I
can't leave out the really interesting pieces of
my narrative merely because you're a lawyer
and hate needless details, sentimental or
otherwise. But <i>do</i> you hate sentimental
details? I don't know. Anyhow, this isn't
a counsel's brief. What was I saying? Oh!
She didn't make a tremendous impression on
me at the moment, but I thought of her afterwards.
I thought of her a good deal in a
quiet way after I had left her&mdash;so much so
that I made a special journey to Ravengar's a
few days afterwards, when there was no real
need for me to go, in order to have a look at
her face again. I should explain that I was
dabbling in finance just then, fairly successfully,
and had transactions with Ravengar.
He didn't know that I was the son of the man
who had taken his stepmother away from his
father, and I never told him I had changed
my name, because the scandals attached to it
by Ravengar and his father had made things
very unpleasant for any bearer of that name.
Still, Ravengar happened to be the man I
wanted to deal with, and so I didn't let any
stupid resentment on my part stop me from
dealing with him. He was a scoundrel, but
he played the game, I may incidentally
mention. I venture to give this frank opinion
about one of your most important clients,
because he'll be dead before you read this,
Polycarp. At least, I expect so.</p>

<p>Well, the day I called specially with a view
to seeing her she was not there. She had left
Ravengar's employment, and disappeared.
Ravengar seemed to be rather perturbed about
it. But perhaps he was perturbed about the
suicide which had recently taken place in his
office. I felt it&mdash;I mean I felt her disappearance.
However, the memory of her face gave
me something very charming to fall back on
in moments of depression, and it was at this
time something occurred sufficient to make me
profoundly depressed for the remainder of my
life. I was over in Paris, and seeing a good
deal of Darcy, my friend the English doctor
there. We were having a long yarn one night
in his rooms over the Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain, and he
said to me suddenly: 'Look here, old chap,
I'm going to do something very unprofessional,
because I fancy you'll thank me for it.'
He said it just like that, bursting out all of a
sudden. So I said, 'Well?' He said: 'It's
very serious, and in nine hundred and ninety-nine
cases out of a thousand I should be a
blundering idiot to tell you.' I said to him:
'You've begun. Finish. And let's see
whether I'll thank you.' He then told me
that I'd got malignant disease of the heart,
might die at any moment, and in any case
couldn't live more than a few years. He said:
'I thought you'd like to know, so that you
could arrange your life accordingly.' I thanked
him. I was really most awfully obliged to him.
It wanted some pluck to tell me. He said: 'I
wouldn't admit to anyone else that I'd told
you.' I never admired Darcy more than I
did that night. His tone was so finely casual.</p>

<p>In something like a month I had got used to
the idea of being condemned to death. At
any rate, it ceased to interfere with my sleep.
I purchased a vault for myself in Brompton
Cemetery. Then I took this flat that I'm
talking in now, and began deliberately to think
over how I should finish my life. I'd got
money&mdash;much more than old Ravengar
imagined&mdash;and I'm a bit of a philosopher, you
know; I have my theories as to what constitutes
real living. However, I won't bother
you with those. I expect they're pretty
crude, after all. Besides, my preparations
were all knocked on the head. I saw Camilla
Payne again in Hugo's. She had stopped
typewriting, and was a milliner there. I tried
my level best to strike up an intimacy with
her, but I failed. She wouldn't have it. The
fact is, I was too rich and showy. And I had
a reputation behind me which, possibly&mdash;well,
you're aware of all that, Polycarp. In about
a fortnight I worshipped her&mdash;yes, I did
actually worship her. I would have done
anything she ordered me, except leave her
alone; and that I wouldn't do. I dare say I
might have got into a sort of friendship with
her if she'd had any home, any relatives, any
place to receive me in. But what can a girl
do with nothing but a bed-sitting-room? I
asked her to go up the river; I asked her to
dinner and to lunch, and to bring her friends
with her; I even asked her to go with me to
an A.B.C. shop, but she wouldn't. She was
quite right, in a general way. How could she
guess I wasn't like the rest, or like what I had
been?</p>

<p>Once, when she let me walk with her from
Hugo's down to Walham Green, I nearly went
mad with joy. I think I verily was mad for
a time. I used to take out licenses for our
marriage, and I used to buy clothes for her&mdash;heaps
of clothes, in case. Yes, I was as good
as mad then. And when she made it clear
that this walking by my side was nothing at
all, meant nothing, and must be construed as
nothing, I grew still more mad.</p>

<p>At last I wrote to her that if she didn't call
and see me at my flat, I should blow my brains
out. I didn't expect her to call, and I did
expect that I should blow my brains out. I
was ready to do so. A year more or a year
less on this earth&mdash;what did it matter to me?</p>

<p>Some people may think&mdash;<i>you</i> may think,
Polycarp&mdash;that a man like me, under sentence
of death from a doctor, had no right to make
love to a woman. That may be so. But in
love there isn't often any question of right.
Human instincts have no regard for human
justice, and when the instinct is strong enough,
the sense of justice simply ceases to exist for
it. When you're in love&mdash;enough&mdash;you don't
argue. You desire&mdash;that's all.</p>

<p>To my amazement, she came to the flat.
When she was announced, I could scarcely
tell the servant to show her in, and when
she entered, I couldn't speak at all for a
moment. She was so&mdash;however, I won't
describe her. I couldn't, for one thing.
No one could describe that woman. She
didn't make any fuss. She didn't cry out that
she had ruined her reputation or anything like
that. She simply said that she had received
my letter, and that she had believed the
sincerity of my threat, while regretting it, and
what did I wish to say to her&mdash;she wouldn't
be able to stay long. It goes without saying
I couldn't begin. I couldn't frame a sentence.
So I suggested we should have some tea.
Accordingly, we had some tea. She poured it
out, and we discussed the furniture of the
drawing-room. I might have known she had
fine taste in furniture. She had. When tea
was over, she seemed to be getting a little
impatient. Then I rang for the tray to be
removed, and as soon as we were alone again,
I started: 'Miss Payne&mdash;'</p>

<p>Now, when I started like that, I hadn't the
ghost of a notion what I was going to say.
And then the idea stepped into my head all
of a sudden: 'Why not tell her exactly what
your situation is? Why not be frank with
her, and see how it works?' It was an inspiration.
Though I didn't believe in it, and
thought in a kind of despair that I was spoiling
my chances, it was emphatically an inspiration,
and I was obliged to obey it.</p>

<p>So I told her what Darcy had told me. I
explained how it was that I couldn't live long.
I said I had nothing to hope for in this world,
no joy, nothing but blackness and horror. I
said how tremendously I was in love with her.
I said I knew she wasn't in love with me, but
at the same time I thought she ought to have
sufficient insight to see that I was fundamentally
a decent chap. I went so far as to
say that I didn't see how she could dislike me.
And I said: 'I ask you to marry me. It will
only be for a year or two, but that year or
two are all my life, while only a fraction of
yours. I am rich, and after my death you
will be rich, and free from the necessity of this
daily drudgery of yours. But I don't ask you
to marry me for money; I ask you to marry
me out of pity. I ask you, out of kindness to
the most unfortunate and hopeless man in the
world, to give me a trifle out of your existence.
Merely out of pity; merely because it is a
woman's part in the world to render pity and
balm. I won't hide anything from you. There
will be the unpleasant business of my sudden
death, which will be a shock to you, even if you
learn to hate me. But you would get over
that. And you would always afterwards have
the consciousness of having changed the last
months of a man's career from hell to heaven.
There's no disguising the fact that it's a
strange proposition I'm making to you, but
the proposition is not more strange than the
situation. Will you consent, or won't you?'
She was going to say something, but I stopped
her. I said: 'Wait a moment. I shan't try
to terrorize you by threats of suicide. And
now, before you say "Yes" or "No," I give
you my solemn word not to commit suicide if
you say "No."' Then I went on in the same
strain appealing to her pity, and telling her
how humble I should be as a husband.</p>

<p>I could see I had moved her; and now I
think over the scene I fancy that my appeal
must have been a lot more touching than I
imagined it was when I was making it.</p>

<p>She said: 'I have always liked you a little.
But I haven't loved you, and I don't love
you.' And then, after a pause&mdash;I was determined
to say nothing more&mdash;she said: 'Yes,
I will marry you. I may be doing wrong&mdash;I
am certainly doing something very unusual;
but I have no one to advise me against it,
and I will follow my impulse and marry you.
I needn't say that I shall do all I can to be
a good wife to you. Ours will be a curious
marriage.... Perhaps, after all, I am very
wicked!'</p>

<p>I cried out: 'No, you aren't&mdash;no you
aren't! The saints aren't in it with you!'</p>

<p>She smiled at this speech. She's so sensible,
Camilla is. She's like a man in some things;
all really great women are.</p>

<p>I could tell you a lot more that passed
immediately afterwards, but I can feel already
my voice is getting a bit tired. Besides, it's
nothing to you, Polycarp.</p>

<p>Then, afterwards, I said: 'You <i>will</i> love
me, you know.'</p>

<p>And I meant it. Any man in similar circumstances
would have said it and meant it.
She smiled again. And then I wanted to be
alone with her, to enjoy the intimacy of her
presence, without a lot of servants all over
the place; so I went out of the drawing-room
and packed off the whole tribe for the evening,
all except Mrs. Dant. I kept Mrs. Dant
to attend on Camilla.</p>

<p>We had dinner sent up; it was like a picnic,
jolly and childish. Camilla was charming.
And then I took photographs of her by flashlight,
with immense success. We developed
them together in the dark-room. That evening
was the first time I had ever been really
happy in all my life. And I was really happy,
although every now and then the idea would
shoot through my head: 'Only for a year or
two at most; perhaps only for a day or two!'</p>

<p>I returned to the dark-room alone for something
or other, and when I came back into
the drawing-room she was not there. By
heaven! my heart went into my mouth. I
feared she had run away, after all. However,
I met her in the passage. She looked
very frightened; her face was quite changed;
but she said nothing had occurred. I kissed
her; she let me.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards she went on to the roof.
She tried to be cheerful, but I saw she had
something on her mind. She said she must
go home, and begged my permission to precede
me into the flat in order to prepare for
her departure. I consented. When ten
minutes had elapsed I followed, and in the
drawing-room, instead of finding Camilla, I
found Louis Ravengar.</p>

<p>I needn't describe my surprise at all that.</p>

<p>Ravengar was beside himself with rage. I
gathered after a time that he claimed Camilla
as his own. He said I had stolen her from
him. I couldn't tell exactly what he was
driving at, but I parleyed with him a little
until I could get my revolver out of a drawer
in my escritoire. He jumped at me. I
thrust him back without firing, and we
stood each of us ready for murder. I couldn't
say how long that lasted. Suddenly he
glanced across the room, and his eyes faltered,
and I became aware that Camilla had entered
silently. I was so startled at her appearance
and by the transformation in Ravengar that
I let off the revolver involuntarily. I heard
Camilla order him, in a sharp, low voice, to
leave instantly. He defied her for a second,
and then went. Before leaving he stuttered,
in a dreadful voice: 'I shall kill you'&mdash;
meaning her. 'I may as well hang for one
thing as for another.'</p>

<p>I said to Camilla, gasping: 'What is it all?
What does it mean?'</p>

<p>She then told me, after confessing that she
had caught Ravengar hiding in the dressing-room,
and had actually suspected that I had
been in league with him against her, that
long ago she had by accident seen Ravengar
commit a crime. She would not tell me what
crime; she would give me no particulars.
Still, I gathered that, if not actually murder,
it was at least homicide. After that Ravengar
had pestered her to marry him&mdash;had even
said that he would be content with a purely
formal marriage; had offered her enormous
sums to agree to his proposal; and had been
constantly repulsed by her. She admitted to
me that he had appeared to be violently in
love with her, but that his motive in wanting
marriage was to prevent her from giving
evidence against him. I asked her why she
had not communicated with the police long
since, and she replied that nothing would
induce her to do that.</p>

<p>'But,' I said, 'he will do his best to kill
you.'</p>

<p>She said: 'I know it.'</p>

<p>And she said it so solemnly that I became
extremely frightened. I knew Ravengar, and
I had marked the tone of his final words; and
the more I pondered the more profoundly I
was imbued with this one idea: 'The life of
my future wife is not safe. Nothing can
make it safe.'</p>

<p>I urged her to communicate with the police.
She refused absolutely.</p>

<p>'Then one day you will be killed,' I said.</p>

<p>She gazed at me, and said: 'Can't you hit
on some plan to keep me safe for a year?'</p>

<p>I demanded: 'Why a year?'</p>

<p>I thought she was thinking of my short
shrift.</p>

<p>She said: 'Because in a year Mr. Ravengar
will probably have&mdash;passed away.'</p>

<p>Not another word of explanation would she
add.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said; 'I can hit on a plan.'</p>

<p>And, as a matter of fact, a scheme had suddenly
flashed into my head.</p>

<p>She asked me what the scheme was. And
I murmured that it began with our marriage
on the following day. I had in my possession
a license which would enable us to go through
the ceremony at once.</p>

<p>'Trust me,' I said. 'You have trusted me
enough to agree to marry me. Trust me in
everything.'</p>

<p>I did not venture to tell her just then what
my scheme was.</p>

<p>She went to her lodging that night in my
brougham. After she had gone I found poor
old Mrs. Dant drugged in the kitchen. On
the next morning Camilla and I were married
at a registry office. She objected to the
registry-office at first, but in the end she
agreed, on the condition that I got her a
spray of orange-blossom to wear at her breast.
It's no business of yours, Polycarp, but I may
tell you that this feminine trait, this almost
childish weakness, in a woman of so superb
and powerful a character, simply enchanted
me. I obtained the orange-blossom.</p>

<p>Then you will remember I sent for you,
Polycarp, made my will, and accompanied
you to my safe in your private vault, in order
to deposit there some secret instructions. I
shall not soon forget your mystification, and
how you chafed under my imperative commands.</p>

<p>Camilla and I departed to Paris, my brain
full of my scheme, and full of happiness, too.
We went to a private hotel to which Darcy
had recommended us, suitable for honeymoons.
The following morning I was, perhaps,
inclined to smile a little at our terror of
Ravengar; but, peeping out of the window
early, I saw Ravengar himself standing on
the pavement in the Rue St. Augustin.</p>

<p>I told Camilla I was going out, and that
she must not leave that room, nor admit
anyone into it, until I returned. I felt that
Ravengar, what with disappointed love, and
jealousy, and fear of the consequences of a
past crime, had developed into a sort of
monomaniac in respect to Camilla. I felt
he was capable of anything. I should not
have been surprised if he had hired a room
opposite to us on the other side of that narrow
street, and directed a fusillade upon Camilla.</p>

<p>When I reached the street he had disappeared&mdash;melted
away.</p>

<p>It was quite early. However, I walked up
the Rue de Grammont, and so to Darcy's, and
I routed him out of bed. I gave him the
entire history of the case. I convinced him
of its desperateness, and I unfolded to him
my scheme. At first he fought shy of it.
He said it might ruin him. He said such
things could not be done in London. I had
meant to carry out the scheme in this flat.
Hence the reason, Polycarp, of the clause in
my will which provides for the sealing up of
the flat in case I die within two months of
my wedding. You see, I feared that I might
be cut off before the plan was carried out or
before all traces of it were cleared away, and
I wanted to keep the place safe from prying
eyes. As it happened, there was no need for
such a precaution, as you will see, and I shall
make a new will to-morrow.</p>

<p>Darcy said suddenly: 'Why not carry out
your plan here in Paris; and now?'</p>

<p>The superior advantages of this alternative
were instantly plain. It would be safer for
Camilla, since it would operate at once; and
also Darcy said that the formal details could
be arranged much better in Paris than in
London, as doctors could be found there who
would sign anything, and clever sculptors,
who did not mind a peculiar commission,
were more easily obtainable in the Quartier
Montparnasse than in the neighbourhood of
the Six Bells and the Arts Club, Chelsea.</p>

<p>We found the doctor and the sculptor.</p>

<p>The hotel was informed that Camilla was
ill, and that the symptom pointed to typhoid
fever. Naturally, she kept her room. That
day the sculptor, a young American, who said
that a thing was 'bully' when he meant it
was good, arrived, and took a mask of Camilla's
head. By the way, this was a most tedious
and annoying process. The two straws
through which the poor girl had to breathe
while her face was covered with that white
stuff&mdash;! Oh, well, I needn't go into that.</p>

<p>The next day typhoid fever was definitely
announced. Hotels generally prefer these
things to be kept secret, but we published it
everywhere&mdash;it was part of our plan. In a
few hours the entire Rue St. Augustin was
aware that the English bride recently arrived
from London was down with typhoid fever.</p>

<p>The disease ran its course. Sometimes
Camilla was better, sometimes worse. Then
all of a sudden a h&aelig;morrhage supervened,
and the young wife died, and the young husband
was stricken with trouble and grief.
The whole street mourned. The death even
got into the Paris dailies, and the correspondence
column of the Paris edition of the <i>New
York Herald</i> was filled with outcries against
the impurities of Parisian water.</p>

<p>It was colossal. I laughed, Polycarp.</p>

<p>My mind unhinged by sorrow, I insisted on
taking the corpse to London for burial. I
had a peculiar affection for the Brompton
Cemetery, though neither her ancestors nor
mine had been buried there. I insisted on
Darcy accompanying me. The procession
left the Rue St. Augustin, and the hotel was
disinfected. This alone cost me a thousand
francs. I gave the sculptor one thousand
five hundred, and the doctor two thousand.
Then there were the expenses of the journey
with the coffin. I forget the figure, but I
know it was prodigious.</p>

<p>But I was content. For, of course, Camilla
was not precisely in that coffin. Camilla had
not been suffering from precisely typhoid
fever. In strict fact, she had never been ill
the least bit in the world. In strict fact, she
had been spirited out of the hotel one night,
and at the very moment when her remains
were crossing the Channel in charge of an
inconsolable widower, she was in the middle
of the Mediterranean on a steamer. The
coffin contained a really wonderful imitation
of her outward form, modelled and coloured
by the American sculptor in a composition
consisting largely of wax. The widower's one
grief was that he was forced to separate himself
from his life's companion for a period of,
at least, a week.</p>

<p>A pretty enough scheme, wasn't it, Polycarp?
We shall shortly bury the wax effigy
in Brompton Cemetery, with the assistance
of Hugo's undertakers, and a parson or so,
and grave-diggers, and registrars of deaths,
and so on and so on. Louis Ravengar will
breathe again, thankful that typhoid fever
has relieved him of an unpleasant incubus,
and since Camilla is underground, he will
speedily forget all about her. She will be
absolutely safe from him. The inconsolable
widower will ostentatiously seek distraction
in foreign travel, and in a fortnight, at most,
will, under another name, resume his connubial
career in a certain villa unsurpassed,
I am told, for its picturesque situation.</p>

<p>To-morrow or the next day I must make
that new will, dispensing with the shutting-up
of the flat. The secret instructions, however,
will stand.</p>

<p>You may wonder why I confide all this to
the phonograph, Polycarp. I will tell you.
The record will be placed by me to-morrow
in my safe in your vault. To-night I shall
lock it up in the safe here. When I am dead,
Polycarp, you will find that the secret instructions
instruct you to realize all my
estate, and to keep the proceeds in negotiable
form until a lady named Mrs. Catherine
Pounds, a widow, comes to you with an autograph
letter from me. You will hand everything
to that lady, or to her representative,
without any further inquiry. But it has
struck me this very day, Polycarp, that you,
with your confounded suspicious and legal
nature, when you see Mrs. Catherine Pounds,
if she should come in person, may recognise
in her a striking resemblance to Camilla.
And you may put difficulties in the way, and
rake up history which was not meant to be
raked up. This phonographic record is to
prevent you from doing so, if by chance you
have an impulse to do so. Think it over
carefully, Polycarp. Consider our situation,
and obey my instructions without a murmur.
The thought of the false death certificates and
burial certificates, and of the unprofessionalism
of Darcy, will abrade your legal susceptibilities;
but submit to the torture for
my sake, Polycarp. You are human. I
shall add to the letter which Mrs. Catherine
Pounds will bring you a note to say that if
you have any scruples, you are to listen to
the phonographic records in the safe; if not,
you are to destroy the phonographic records.</p>

<p>Do I seem gay, Polycarp?</p>

<p>I ought to be. I have carried through my
scheme. I have outwitted Ravengar. I have
saved Camilla from death at his hands. I
can look forward to an idyll&mdash;brief, perhaps,
but ecstatic&mdash;in a villa with the loveliest
view on all the Mediterranean. I ought to
be gay. And yet I am not. And it is not
the knowledge of my fatal disease that
saddens me. No; I think I have been saddened
by a day and a night spent with that
coffin. It is a fraud of a coffin, but it exists.
And when I saw it just now occupying the
drawing-room, it gave me a sudden shock.
It somehow took hold of my imagination. I
was obliged to look within, and to touch the
waxen image there. And that image seemed
unholy. I did not care to dwell on the
thought of it going into the ground, with all
the solemnities of the real thing. What do
you suppose will happen to that waxen image
on the Judgment Day, Polycarp? Surely,
someone in authority, possibly a steward,
fussy and overworked, will exclaim: 'There
is some mistake here!' I can hear you say
that I am mad, Polycarp, that Francis Tudor
was always a little 'wrong.' But I am not
mad. It is only that my brain is too agile,
too fanciful. I am a great deal more sane
than you, Polycarp.</p>

<p>And I am trying to put some heart into
myself. I am trying to make ready to enjoy
the brief ecstatic future where Camilla awaits
me. But I am so tired, Polycarp. And
there's no disguising the fact that it's an
awful nuisance never to be quite sure whether
you won't fall down dead the next minute or
the next second. I must go in and have
another glance at that singular swindle of a
coffin.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The phonograph went off into an inarticulate
whirr of its own machinery. The recital
was over. Tudor must have died immediately
after securing the record in the safe in his
bedroom, where Hugo had just listened to it.</p>

<p>'She lives!' was Hugo's sole thought.</p>

<p>The profound and pathetic tragedy of
Tudor's career did not touch him until long
afterwards.</p>

<p>'She lives! Ravengar lives! Ravengar
probably knows where she is, and I do not
know! And Ravengar is at large! I have set
him at large.'</p>

<p>His mind a battlefield on which the most
glorious hope struggled against a frenzied fear,
Hugo rose from the chair in front of the
phonograph-stand, and, after a slight hesitation,
left the flat as he had entered it. Before
dawn the pane had been replaced in the
drawing-room window, and the side-door
secured.</p>

<h2>'ARE YOU THERE?'</h2>


<p>The next morning Hugo's dreams seemed to
be concerned chiefly with a telephone, and the
telephone-bell of his dreams made the dreams
so noisy that even while asleep he knew that
his rest was being outrageously disturbed.
He tried to change the subject of his fantastic
visions, but he could not, and the telephone-bell
rang nearly all the time. This was the
more annoying in that he had taken elaborate
precautions to secure perfect repose. Perfect
repose was what he needed after quitting
Tudor's flat. He felt that he had stood as
much as a man can expect himself to stand.
In the vault, and again in the flat, his life had
been in danger; he had suffered the ignominy
of the ruined sale; he had come to grips with
Ravengar, and let Ravengar go free; he had
listened to the amazing recital of the phonograph.
Moreover, between the interview with
Ravengar and the burglary of the flat he had
summoned his Council of Ten, or, rather, his
Council of Nine (Bentley being absent, dead),
had addressed all his employ&eacute;s, had separated
three traitorous shopwalkers, ten traitorous
cashiers, and forty-two traitorous servers
from the main body, and sent them packing,
had arranged for the rehabilitation of Lady
Brice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kentucky-Webster), had appointed
a new guardian to the Safe Deposit, had got
on the track of the stolen stoles, and had
approved special advertisements for every
daily paper in London.</p>

<p>And, finally and supremely, he had experienced
the greatest stroke of joy, ecstatic and
bewildering joy, of his whole existence&mdash;the
news that Camilla lived. It was this tremendous
feeling of joy, and not by any means his
complex and variegated worries, that might
have prevented him from obtaining the sleep
which Nature demanded.</p>

<p>On reaching the dome at 2 a.m., he had
taken four tabloids, each containing 0&middot;324
gramme of trional, and had drunk the glass
of hot milk which Simon always left him in
case he should want it. And he had written
on a sheet of paper the words: 'I am not to
be disturbed before 10 a.m., no matter what
happens; but call me at ten.&mdash;H.'; and had
put the sheet of paper on Simon's door-mat.
And then he had stumbled into bed, and abandoned
himself to sleep&mdash;not without reluctance,
for he did not care to lose, even for a
few hours, the fine consciousness of that sheer
joy. He desired to rush off instantly into
the universe at large and discover Camilla,
wherever she might be.</p>

<p>Of course, he had dreamed of Camilla, but
the telephone-bell had drowned the remembered
accents of her voice. The telephone-bell
had silenced everything. The telephone-bell
had grown from a dream into a nightmare;
and at last he had said to himself in the
nightmare: 'I might just as well be up and
working as lying throttled here by this confounded
nightmare.' And by an effort of will
he had wakened. And even after he was
roused, and had switched on the light, which
showed the hands of the clock at a quarter to
ten, he could still hear the telephone-bell of
his nightmare. And then the truth occurred
to him, as the truth does occur surprisingly
to people whose sleep has been disturbed,
that the telephone-bell was a real telephone-bell,
and not in the least the telephone-bell
of a dream, and it was ringing, ringing,
ringing in the dome. There were fifteen lines
of telephone in the Hugo building, and one of
them ran to the dome. Few persons called
him up on it, because few persons knew its
precise number, but he used it considerably
himself.</p>

<p>'Anyhow,' he murmured, 'I've had over
seven and a half hours' sleep, and that's
something.'</p>

<p>And as he got out of bed to go across to the
telephone, his great joy resumed possession
of him, and he was rather glad than otherwise
that the telephone had forced him to wake.</p>

<p>'Well, well, well?' he cried comically,
lifting the ear-piece off the hook and stopping
the bell.</p>

<p>'Are you there?' the still small voice of
the telephone whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>'I should think I was here!' he cried.
'Who are you?'</p>

<p>'Are you Mr. Hugo?' asked the voice.</p>

<p>'I'm what's left of Mr. Hugo,' he answered
in a sort of drunken tone. The power of the
sedative was still upon him. 'Who are you?
You've pretty nearly rung my head off.'</p>

<p>'I just want to say good-bye to you,' said
the voice.</p>

<p>'What!'</p>

<p>Hugo started, glancing round the vast room,
which was in shadow except where a solitary
light threw its yellow glare on the dial of the
clock.</p>

<p>'Are you there?' asked the voice patiently
once again.</p>

<p>'It isn't'&mdash;something prompted him to use
a Christian name&mdash;'it isn't Louis?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Where are you, then?' Hugo demanded.</p>

<p>'Not far off,' replied the mysterious voice
in the telephone.</p>

<p>It was unmistakably the voice of Louis
Ravengar, but apparently touched with some
new quality, some quality of resigned and
dignified despair. Hugo wondered where the
man could be. And the sinister magic of
the telephone, which brought this sad, quiet
voice to him from somewhere out of the
immensity of England, but which would not
yield up the secret of its hiding, struck him
strangely.</p>

<p>'Are you there?' said the voice yet again.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>Hugo shivered, but whether it was from
cold&mdash;he wore nothing but his pyjamas&mdash;or
from apprehension he could not decide.</p>

<p>'I'm saying good-bye,' said the voice once
more. 'I suppose you mean to have the
police after me, and so I mean to get out of
their way. See? But first I wished to tell
you&mdash;<i>crrrck cluck</i>&mdash;Eh? What?'</p>

<p>'I didn't speak.'</p>

<p>'It's these Exchange hussies, then. I
wanted to tell you I've thought a lot about our
interview last night. What you said was true
enough, Owen. I admit that, and so I am
going to end it. Eh? Are you there?
That girl keeps putting me off.'</p>

<p>'End what?'</p>

<p>'End <i>it</i>&mdash;<i>it</i>&mdash;<i>it</i>! I'm not making anybody
happy, not even myself, and so I'm going to
end it. But I'll tell you her address first. I
know it.'</p>

<p>'Whose address?'</p>

<p>'Hers&mdash;Camilla's. If I tell you, will you
promise not to say a word about me speaking
to you on the telephone this morning?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Not a word under any circumstances?'</p>

<p>'Certainly.'</p>

<p>'Well, it's 17, Place Saint-&Eacute;tienne, Bruges,
Belgium.'</p>

<p>'17, Place Saint-&Eacute;tienne, Bruges. That's
all right. I shan't forget. Look here, Louis,
you'd better clear out of England. Go to
America. Do you hear? I don't understand
this about "ending it." You surely aren't
thinking of&mdash;'</p>

<p>He felt quite magnanimous towards Ravengar.
And he was aware that he could get to
Bruges in six hours or so.</p>

<p>'That idea of yours about chloroform,' said
the voice, 'and going into the vault, and being
shut up there, is a very good one. Nobody
would know, except the person whom one
paid to shut the door after one.'</p>

<p>'I say, where are you?' Hugo asked curtly.
He was at a loss how to treat these singular
confidences.</p>

<p>'And so is that idea good about merely
ending one incarnation and beginning another.
That's much better than calling it death.'</p>

<p>'I shall ring you off,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>'Wait a moment,' said the voice, still
patiently. 'If you should hear the name
Callear&mdash;'</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>'Well?' Hugo inquired, 'what name?'</p>

<p>'Callear&mdash;C-a-l-l-e-a-r. If you should hear
that name soon&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What then?'</p>

<p>'Remember your promise of secrecy&mdash;that's
all. Good-bye.'</p>

<p>'I wish you'd tell me where you are.'</p>

<p>'Not far off,' said the voice. 'I shall never
be far off, I think. When you've found
Camilla and brought her here'&mdash;the tone of
the voice changed and grew almost malignant
despite its reticence&mdash;'you'd like to know
that I was always near to, somewhere underneath,
mouldering, wouldn't you?'</p>

<p>'What did you say?'</p>

<p>'I said mouldering. Good-bye.'</p>

<p>'But look here&mdash;'</p>

<p>The bell rang off. Louis Ravengar had
finished his good-bye. Hugo tried in vain to
resume communication with him. He could
not even get any sort of reply from the
Exchange.</p>

<p>'It's a queer world,' he soliloquized, as he
returned to bed. 'What does the man mean?'</p>

<p>He was still happy in the prospect of finding
Camilla, but it was as though his happiness
were a pool in a private ground, and some
trespasser had troubled it with a stone.</p>

<p>The clock struck ten, and Simon entered
with tea and the paper.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<h2>SUICIDE</h2>


<p>The paper contained a whole-page advertisement
of Hugo's great annual sale, and
also a special half-page advertisement headed
'Hugo's Apology and Promise'&mdash;a message
to the public asking pardon of the public for
the confusion, inconvenience, and disappointments
of the previous day, hinting that the
mystery of the affair would probably be
elucidated in a criminal court, and stating
that a prodigious number of silvered fox-stoles
would positively be available from nine
o'clock that morning at a price even lower
than the figure named in the original announcement.
The message further stated
that a special Complaint Office had been
opened as a branch of the Inquiry Bureau,
and that all complaints by customers who had
suffered on New Year's Day would there be
promptly and handsomely dealt with.</p>

<p>In addition to Hugo's advertisements,
there were several columns of news describing
the singular phenomena of the sale, concluding
with what a facetious reporter had entitled
'Interviews with Survivors.'</p>

<p>As he read the detailed accounts Hugo
knew, perhaps for the first time in his life,
what it was 'to go hot and cold all over.'
However, he was decidedly inclined to be
optimistic.</p>

<p>'Anyhow,' he said, 'it's the best ad. I ever
had. Still, it's a mercy there were no deaths.'</p>

<p>He began to dress hurriedly, furiously.
Already the second day of the sale had been
in progress for more than an hour, and he had
not even visited the scene of the campaign.
Simon had said nothing; it was not Simon's
habit to speak till he was spoken to. And
Hugo did not feel inclined to ask questions;
he preferred to reconnoitre in person. Yes,
he would descend instantly, and afterwards,
when he had satisfied himself that the evil
had been repaired, he would consider about
Camilla.... By neglecting all else, he
could reach her in time for dinner.... Should
he?... (At this point he plunged
into his cold bath.) ... No! He was Hugo
before he was Camilla's lover. He would be
a tradesman for yet another ten hours. He
had a duty to London....</p>

<p>Then Ravengar wandered into his thoughts
and confused them.</p>

<p>Just as he was assuming his waistcoat,
Simon entered.</p>

<p>'Mr. Galpin, sir.'</p>

<p>'And who the d---l is Mr. Galpin?' asked
Hugo.</p>

<p>'Mr. Galpin is the gentleman who saved
your life yesterday, sir,' said Simon with
admirable sangfroid. 'He has called for a
hundred pounds.'</p>

<p>'Show him in here immediately,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>Mr. Galpin appeared in the dressing-room,
looking more than ever like an extremely
successful commercial traveller. Hugo could
not think of any introductory remark worthy
of the occasion.</p>

<p>'I needn't say how grateful I am,' Hugo
began.</p>

<p>'Certainly you needn't,' said Mr. Galpin.
'I understand. I've been under lock and
key myself.'</p>

<p>'I should offer you more than this paltry
sum,' said Hugo, with a smile, 'but I know,
of course, that a man like you can always
obtain all the money he really wants.'</p>

<p>Mr. Galpin smiled, too.</p>

<p>'However,' continued Hugo, detaching his
watch from his waistcoat, 'I will ask you to
take something that you can't get elsewhere.
This is the thinnest watch in the world.
Br&eacute;guet, of the Rue de la Paix, Paris, made it
specially for me. It is exactly the same size
as a five-shilling piece. It repeats the quarters,
shows the time in four cities, and does practically
everything except tell the weather
and the political party in power. It has one
drawback. Only Br&eacute;guet can clean it, and
he will charge you five guineas for the job,
besides probably having you arrested for
unlawful possession. I must write to him.
Such as it is, accept it.'</p>

<p>The golden, jewelled toy was offered and
received with a bow. The practised hands of
Mr. Galpin had opened the case in two
seconds.</p>

<p>'How do you regulate it?' demanded Mr.
Galpin, staring at the movement.</p>

<p>'You don't,' said Hugo proudly; 'it never
needs it.'</p>

<p>Mr. Galpin stood corrected.</p>

<p>'If there's anything in my line I can do for
you at any time, sir,' said he.</p>

<p>Hugo pondered.</p>

<p>Mr. Galpin put the watch in his waistcoat-pocket,
and, tearing the hundred-pound note
in two halves, placed one half in the left breast
pocket of his coat, and the other half in the
right breast pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>'Could you have opened that vault,' Hugo
asked, 'if both keys had been lost?'</p>

<p>'No, sir, I could not. It's such people as
you who are ruining my profession, sir.'</p>

<p>'You think the vault is impregnable?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Galpin. 'I should say
its name was just about as near being Gibraltar
as makes no matter.'</p>

<p>'I was only wondering,' Hugo mused aloud,
'only wondering.... Ah, well, I won't
trouble you with my fancies.'</p>

<p>'As you wish, sir. Good-bye.'</p>

<p>'Good-bye, Mr. Galpin. And thank you!'</p>

<p>'Thank <i>you</i>, sir,' said Mr. Galpin, and disappeared.</p>

<p>'Simon,' Hugo ordered immediately afterwards,
handing Simon the token, 'run down
and get me the best gold watch in the place.'</p>

<p>Throughout the morning Hugo's thoughts
were far away. Most frequently they were
in Belgium, but now and then they paid a
strange incomprehensible visit with Ravengar
to the vault.</p>

<p>While he was lunching under the dome,
Albert Shawn came in with the early edition
of the <i>Evening Herald</i>, containing a prominent
item headed, 'Feared Suicide of Mr. Louis
Ravengar.' The paper stated that Mr.
Ravengar had gone to Dover on the previous
evening, had been seen to board the Calais
steamer, and had been missed soon after the
boat had left the harbour. His hat, umbrella,
rug, and bag had been found on deck. As
the night was quite calm, there could be no
other explanation than that of suicide. The
<i>Evening Herald</i> gave a sympathetic biography
of Mr. Ravengar ('one of our proprietors'),
and attributed his suicide to a fit of depression
caused by the entirely groundless rumours
which had circulated during the late afternoon
connecting him with the scandalous disturbances
at Hugo's sale.</p>

<p>Hugo dropped the organ of public opinion.</p>

<p>'H'm!' he observed to Albert.</p>

<p>'I'm not surprised, sir,' said Albert.</p>

<p>'Aren't you?' said Hugo. 'Then, there's
nothing more to be said.'</p>

<p>Since Louis Ravengar had certainly been
talking with Hugo that selfsame morning, it
was obviously impossible that he should have
committed suicide in the English Channel
some twelve hours earlier. Why, then, had
he arranged for this elaborate deception to
be practised? What was his scheme? His
voice through the telephone had been so quiet,
so resigned, so pathetic; only towards the end
had it become malevolent.</p>

<p>Hugo perceived that he must go down to
the vault. No! He dared not go himself.
The sight of that vault, after yesterday's
emotions, would surely be beyond his power
to bear!</p>

<p>'Albert,' he said, 'go to the Safe Deposit.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'And inquire if anyone named&mdash;'</p>

<p>Hugo stopped.</p>

<p>'Named what, sir?'</p>

<p>'Never mind. I'll go myself. By the
way,' he said, 'I must run over to Belgium
to-night. Perhaps I may take you with me.'</p>

<p>'Don't forget the inquest on Bentley
to-morrow, sir. You'll have to attend that.'</p>

<p>Hugo made a gesture of excessive annoyance.
He had forgotten the inquest.</p>

<p>'Take this telegram,' he said, suddenly
inspired; and he scribbled out the following
words: 'Darcy, 16, Boulevard des Italiens,
Paris. Please come instantly; urgent case.&mdash;HUGO,
London.'</p>

<p>'At any rate, I've made a beginning,' he
murmured when Albert had gone. 'I can
find out all that is to be known about Camilla
from Darcy&mdash;if he comes. I wonder if he'll
come. He'd better.'</p>

<p>And then, collecting his powers of self-control,
he went slowly down to the Safe
Deposit, and entered those steely and dreadful
portals.</p>

<p>'Getting on all right?' he said to the newly-installed
manager, a young man with light
hair from the counting-house.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>'Any new customers?'</p>

<p>He trembled for the reply.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. Two gentlemen came as soon as
we opened this morning, and took Vault 39.
They paid a year's rent in advance. Two
hundred pounds.'</p>

<p>'What did they want a whole vault for?'</p>

<p>'I can't say, sir. There was a lot of going
to and fro with parcels and things, sir, and a
lot of telephoning in the waiting-room. And
one of them asked for a glass and some water.
They were here a long time, sir.'</p>

<p>'When did they go?'</p>

<p>'It was about ten-thirty, sir, when one of
the two gentlemen called me to bring my key
and lock up the vault. The vault was properly
locked, first with his key, and then with mine,
and then he left. Perhaps it might be a
quarter to eleven, sir.'</p>

<p>'But the other gentleman?'</p>

<p>'Oh, he must have slipped off earlier, sir.
I didn't see him go.'</p>

<p>'What did he look like?'</p>

<p>'Oldish man, Mr. Hugo. Gray.'</p>

<p>The manager was somewhat mystified by
this cross-examination.</p>

<p>'And the name?'</p>

<p>'The name? Let me see. Callear. Yes,
Callear, sir.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'C-a-l-l-e-a-r.'</p>

<p>'What was the address?'</p>

<p>'Hotel Cecil. He said he would send a
permanent address in a day or two.'</p>

<p>In half an hour Hugo had ascertained that
no person named Callear was staying at the
Hotel Cecil.</p>

<p>He understood now, understood too clearly,
the meanings of Ravengar's strange utterances
on the telephone. The man had determined to
commit suicide, and he had chosen a way
which was calculated with the most appalling
ingenuity to ruin, if anything would ruin,
Hugo's peace of mind for years to come&mdash;perhaps
for ever. For the world, Ravengar
was drowned. But Hugo knew that his body
was lying in that vault.</p>

<p>'Louis had an accomplice,' Hugo reflected.
'Who can that have been? Who could have
been willing to play so terrible a r&ocirc;le?'</p>

<h2>DARCY</h2>


<p>That night, when he was just writing out
some cheques in aid of charities conducted by
Lady Brice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Kentucky-Webster), Simon
entered with a card. The hour was past eleven.</p>

<p>Hugo read on the card, 'Docteur Darcy.'</p>

<p>He had nearly forgotten that he had sent
for Darcy; in fact, he was no longer quite sure
why he had sent for him, since he meant, in
any case, to hasten to Belgium at the earliest
moment.</p>

<p>'You are exceedingly prompt, doctor,' he
said, when Darcy came into the dome. 'I
thank you.'</p>

<p>The cosmopolitan physician appeared to be
wearing the same tourist suit that he had
worn on the night of Tudor's death. The
sallowness of his impassive face had increased
somewhat, and his long thin hands had their
old lackadaisical air. 'You don't look at all
the man for such a part,' said Hugo in the
privacy of his brain, 'but you played your
part devilish well that night, my pale friend.
You deceived me perfectly.'</p>

<p>'Prompt?' smiled the doctor, shaking
hands, and removing his overcoat with
fatigued gestures.</p>

<p>'Yes; you must have caught the 4 p.m.
express, and come via Folkstone and Boulogne.'</p>

<p>'I did,' said Darcy.</p>

<p>'And yet I expect you didn't get my telegram
till after two o'clock.'</p>

<p>'I have received no telegram from you, my
dear Mr. Hugo. It had not arrived when I
left.'</p>

<p>'Then your presence here to-night is due
to a coincidence merely?'</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said Darcy; 'it is due to an
extreme desire on my part to talk to you.'</p>

<p>'The desire is mutual,' Hugo answered,
gently insisting that Darcy should put away
his cigarettes and take a Muria. 'Dare I
ask&mdash;'</p>

<p>Darcy had become suddenly nervous, and
he burst out, interrupting Hugo:</p>

<p>'The suicide of Mr. Ravengar was in this
morning's Paris papers. And I may tell you
at once that it's in connection with that affair
that I'm here.'</p>

<p>'I also&mdash;' Hugo began.</p>

<p>'I may tell you at once,' Darcy proceeded
with increasing self-consciousness, 'that when
I had the pleasure of meeting you before, Mr.
Hugo, I was forced by circumstances, and by
my promise to a dead friend, to behave in a
manner which was very distasteful to me. I
was obliged to lie to you, to play a trick on
you&mdash;in short&mdash;well, I can only ask you for
your sympathy. I have a kind of a forlorn
notion that you'll understand&mdash;after I've
explained, as I mean to do&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If you refer to the pretended death of
Tudor's wife&mdash;' said Hugo.</p>

<p>'Then you know?' Darcy cried, astounded.</p>

<p>'I know. I know everything, or nearly
everything.'</p>

<p>'How?' Darcy retreated towards the piano.</p>

<p>'I will explain how some other time,' Hugo
replied, going also to the piano and facing
his guest. 'You did magnificently that night,
doctor. Don't imagine for a moment that
my feelings towards you in regard to that
disastrous evening are anything but those
of admiration. And now tell me about her&mdash;about
<i>her</i>. She is well?'</p>

<p>Hugo put a hand on the man's shoulder,
and persuaded him back to his chair.</p>

<p>'She is well&mdash;I hope and believe,' answered
Darcy.</p>

<p>'You don't see her often?'</p>

<p>'On the contrary, I see her every day,
nearly.'</p>

<p>'But if she lives at Bruges and you are in
Paris&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Bruges?'</p>

<p>'Yes; Place Saint-&Eacute;tienne.'</p>

<p>Darcy thought for a second.</p>

<p>'So it's <i>you</i> who have been on the track,'
he murmured.</p>

<p>Hugo, too, became meditative in his turn.</p>

<p>'I wish you would tell me all that happened
since&mdash;since that night,' he said at
length.</p>

<p>'I ask nothing better,' said Darcy. 'Since
Ravengar is dead and all danger passed, there
is no reason why you should not know everything
that is to be known. Well, Mr. Hugo,
I have had an infinity of trouble with that
girl.'</p>

<p>Hugo's expression gave pause to the doctor.</p>

<p>'I mean with Mrs. Tudor,' he added correctively.
'I'll begin at the beginning. After
the disappearance&mdash;the typhoid disappearance,
you know&mdash;she went to Algiers. Tudor
had taken a villa at Mustapha Sup&eacute;rieure,
the healthiest suburb of the town. After
Tudor's sudden death I telegraphed to her
to come back to me in Paris. I couldn't
bring myself to wire that Tudor was dead.
I only said he was ill. And at first she
wouldn't come. She thought it was a ruse
of Ravengar's. She thought Ravengar had
discovered her hiding-place, and all sorts of
things. However, in the end she came. I
met her at Marseilles. You wouldn't believe,
Mr. Hugo, how shocked she was by the news
of her husband's death. Possibly I didn't
break it to her too neatly. She didn't pretend
to love him&mdash;never had done&mdash;but she
was shocked all the same. I had a terrible
scene with her at the Hotel Terminus at Marseilles.
Her whole attitude towards the marriage
changed completely. She insisted that
it was plain to her then that she had simply
sold herself for money. She said she hated
herself. And she swore she would never
touch a cent of Tudor's fortune&mdash;not even
if the fortune went to the Crown in default
of legal representatives.'</p>

<p>'Poor creature!' Hugo breathed.</p>

<p>'However,' Darcy proceeded, 'something
had to be done. She was supposed to be
dead, and if her life was to be saved from
Ravengar's vengeance, she just had to continue
to be dead&mdash;at any rate, as regards
England. So she couldn't go back to England.
Now I must explain that my friend
Tudor hadn't left her with much money.'</p>

<p>'That was careless.'</p>

<p>'It was,' Darcy admitted. 'Still, he
naturally relied on me in case of necessity.
And quite rightly. I was prepared to let
Mrs. Tudor have all the money she wanted,
she repaying me as soon as events allowed
her to handle Tudor's estate. But as she
had decided never to handle Tudor's estate,
she had no prospect of being able to repay
me. Hence she would accept nothing. Hence
she began to starve. Awkward, wasn't it?'</p>

<p>'I see clearly that she could not come to
England to earn her living,' said Hugo, 'but
could she not have earned it in Paris?'</p>

<p>'No,' Darcy replied; 'she couldn't earn it
regularly. And the reason was that she was
too beautiful. Situation after situation was
made impossible for her. She might easily
have married in Paris, but earn her living
there&mdash;no! In the end she was obliged to
accept money from me, but only in very
small sums, such as she could repay without
much difficulty when Ravengar's death should
permit her to return to England. She was
always sure of Ravengar's death, but she
would never tell me why. And now he's dead.'</p>

<p>'And there is no further obstacle to her
coming to England?'</p>

<p>'None whatever. That is to say&mdash;except
one.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' Hugo demanded.</p>

<p>Darcy had flushed.</p>

<p>'I'm in a very delicate position,' said Darcy.
'I've got to explain to you something that a
man can't explain without looking an ass.
The fact is&mdash;of course, you see, Mr. Hugo, I
did all I could for her all the time. Not out
of any special regard for her, but for Tudor's
sake, you understand. She's awfully beautiful,
and all that. I've nothing against her.
But I believe I told you last year that I had
been in love once. That "once" was enough.
I've done with women, Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>'But how does this affect&mdash;' Hugo began
to inquire, rather inimically.</p>

<p>'Can't you see? She doesn't <i>want</i> to
leave Paris. I did all I could for her all the
time. I've been her friend in adversity, and
so on, and so on, and she's&mdash;she's&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What on earth are you driving at, man?'</p>

<p>'She's fallen in love with me. That's what
I'm driving at. And now you know.'</p>

<p>'My dear sir,' said Hugo earnestly, 'if she
is in love with you, you must marry her and
make her happy.'</p>

<p>He did not desire to say this, but some
instinct within him compelled him to utter
the words.</p>

<p>'You told me that you loved her,' Darcy
retorted.</p>

<p>'I told you the truth. I do.'</p>

<p>A silence ensued. All Hugo's previous discouragements,
sadnesses, preoccupations, despairs,
were as nothing in comparison with
the black mood which came upon him when
he learnt this simple fact&mdash;that Camilla had
fallen in love with Darcy.</p>

<p>'She is still in Paris?' he asked, to end the
silence.</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I don't know. I called at her lodgings
at noon, and she had gone and left no address.'</p>

<p>Hugo jumped up.</p>

<p>'She can't have disappeared again?'</p>

<p>'Oh no; rest assured. Doubtless a mere
change of rooms. When I return I shall
certainly find a letter awaiting me.'</p>

<p>'Why did you come to me?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Darcy said, 'you told me you loved
her, and I thought&mdash;I thought perhaps you'd
come over to Paris, and see&mdash;see what could
be done. That's why I came. The thing's
on my mind, you know.'</p>

<p>'Just so,' Hugo answered, 'and I will
come.'</p>

<h2>FIRST TRIUMPH OF SIMON</h2>


<p>A week later, Simon and Albert stood talking
together in Simon's room adjoining the dome.
Simon had that air of absolute spruceness and
freshness which in persons who have stayed
at home is so extremely offensive to persons
who have just arrived exhausted and unclean
from a tiresome journey. It was Albert who,
with Hugo, had arrived from the journey.</p>

<p>'Had a good time, Alb?' Simon asked.</p>

<p>'So-so,' said Albert cautiously.</p>

<p>'By the way, what did you go to Paris <i>for</i>?'</p>

<p>'Didn't you know?'</p>

<p>'How should I know, my son?'</p>

<p>'The governor wanted to find that girl of
his.'</p>

<p>'What girl?' Simon asked innocently.</p>

<p>'Oh, chuck it, Si!' Albert remonstrated
against these affectations of ignorance in a
relative from whom he had no secrets.</p>

<p>'You mean Mrs. Tudor?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'She's disappeared again, has she? And
you couldn't find her?'</p>

<p>Albert concurred.</p>

<p>'It seems to me, Alb,' said Simon, 'that
you aren't shining very brilliantly just now
as a detective. And I'm rather surprised,
because I've been doing a bit of detective
work myself, and it's nothing but just using
your eyes.'</p>

<p>'What have you been up to?' Albert inquired.</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing. Never you mind. It's
purely unofficial. You see, I'm not a
detective. I'm only a servant that gets left
at home. I've only been amusing myself.
Still, I've found out a thing or two that you'd
give your eyes to know, my son.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>Albert pursued his quest of knowledge.</p>

<p>'You get along home to your little wife,'
Simon enjoined him. 'You're a professional
detective, you are. No doubt when you've
recovered from Paris, and got into your stride,
you'll find out all that I know and a bit over
in about two seconds. Off you go!'</p>

<p>Simon's eyes glinted.</p>

<p>And later, when he was giving Hugo the
last ministrations for the night, Simon looked
at his lord as a cat looks at the mouse it is
playing with&mdash;humorously, viciously, sarcastically.</p>

<p>'I'll give him a night to lie awake in,' said
Simon's eyes.</p>

<p>But he only allowed his eyes to make
this speech while Hugo's back was turned.</p>

<p>The next morning Hugo's mood was desolating.
To speak to him was to play with
fire. Obviously, Hugo had heard the clock
strike all the hours. Nevertheless, Simon
permitted himself to be blithe, even offensively
blithe. And when Hugo had finished
with him he ventured to linger.</p>

<p>'You needn't wait,' said Hugo, in a voice
of sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>'So you didn't find Mrs. Francis Tudor,
sir?' responded Simon, with calm and beautiful
insolence.</p>

<p>It was insolence because, though few of
Hugo's secrets were hid from Simon, the
intercourse between master and servant
was conducted on the basis of a convention
that Simon's ignorance of Hugo's affairs was
complete. And if the convention was ignored,
as it sometimes was, Hugo alone had
the right to begin the ignoring of it.</p>

<p>'What's that you said?' Hugo demanded.</p>

<p>'You didn't find Mrs. Francis Tudor, sir?'
Simon blandly repeated.</p>

<p>'Mind your own business, my friend,' he
said.</p>

<p>'Certainly, sir,' said Simon. 'But I had
intended to add that possibly you had not
been searching for Mrs. Tudor in the right
city.'</p>

<p>Hugo stared at Simon, who retreated to
the door.</p>

<p>'What in thunder do you mean?' Hugo
asked coldly and deliberately.</p>

<p>At last Simon felt a tremor.</p>

<p>'I mean, sir, that I think I know where
she is. At least, I know where she will be
in a couple of hours' time.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'In Department 42&mdash;her old department,
sir.'</p>

<p>By a terrific effort Hugo kept calm.</p>

<p>'Simon,' he said, 'don't play any tricks on
me. If you do, I'll thrash you first, and then
dismiss you on the spot.'</p>

<p>'It's through the new manager of the
drapery, sir, in place of Mr. Bentley&mdash;I forget
his name. Mr. Bentley's room being all upset
with police and accountants and things, the
new manager has been using your office. And
I was in there to-day, and he was engaging a
young lady for the millinery, sir. He didn't
recognise her, not having been here long
enough, but I did. It was Miss Payne.'</p>

<p>'Impossible!'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir; Miss Payne&mdash;that is to say, Mrs.
Tudor. I heard him say, "Very well, you
can start to-morrow morning."'</p>

<p>'That's <i>this</i> morning?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Why didn't you tell me this last night?'
Hugo roared.</p>

<p>'It slipped my memory, sir,' said Simon,
surpassing all previous feats of insolence.</p>

<p>Hugo, speechless, waved him out of the
room.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<h2>THE LODGING-HOUSE</h2>


<p>The thought of soon seeing her intoxicated
him. His head swam, his heart leapt, his
limbs did what they liked, being forgotten.
And then, as he sobered himself, he tried
seriously to find an answer to this question:
Why had she returned, as it were surreptitiously,
to the very building from which her
funeral was supposed to have taken place?
Could she imagine that oblivion had covered
her adventure, and that the three thousand
five hundred would ignore the fact that she
was understood to be dead? He found no
answer&mdash;at least, no satisfactory answer&mdash;except
that women are women, and therefore
incalculable.</p>

<p>'Go and see if she is there,' he said to
Simon at five minutes to nine.</p>

<p>'She is there,' said Simon at five minutes
past nine; 'in one of the work-rooms alone.'</p>

<p>Then Hugo put a heavy curb on his instincts,
and came to a sudden resolve.</p>

<p>'Tell the new drapery manager,' he instructed
Simon, 'to give instructions to Mrs.
Tudor, or Miss Payne, whichever she calls
herself, that she is to meet him in my central
office at six o'clock this evening. He, however,
is not to be there. She is to wait in
the room alone, if I have not arrived. Inform
no one that I have returned from Paris. I
am now going out for the day.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>Hugo thereupon took train to Ealing. He
walked circuitously through the middle of
the day from Ealing to Harrow, alone with
his thoughts in the frosty landscape. From
Harrow he travelled by express to Euston,
reaching town at five-thirty. Somehow or
other the day had passed. He got to Sloane
Street at six, and ascended direct to his central
office.</p>

<p>Had his orders been executed? Would
she be waiting? As he hesitated outside
the door he was conscious that his whole
frame shook. He entered silently.</p>

<p>Yes, she was there. She sat on the edge
of a chair near the fire, staring at the fire.
She was dressed in the customary black.
Ah! it was the very face he had seen in the
coffin, the same marvellous and incomparable
features; not even sadder, not aged by a day;
the same!</p>

<p>She turned at the sound of the closing of
the door, and, upon seeing him, started
slightly. Then she rose, and delicately blushed.</p>

<p>'Good-evening, Mr. Hugo,' she said, in a
low, calm voice. 'I did not expect to see
you.'</p>

<p>Great poetical phrases should have rushed
to his lips&mdash;phrases meet for a tremendous
occasion. But they did not. He sighed.
'I can only say what comes into my head,'
he thought ruefully. And he said:</p>

<p>'Did I startle you?'</p>

<p>'Not much,' she replied. 'I knew I must
meet you one day or another soon. And it
is better at once.'</p>

<p>'Just so,' he said. 'It <i>is</i> better at once.
Sit down, please. I've been walking all day,
and I can scarcely stand.' And he dropped
into a chair. 'Do you know, dear lady,' he
proceeded, 'that Doctor Darcy and I have
been hunting for you all over Paris?'</p>

<p>He managed to get a little jocularity into
his tone, and this achievement eased his
attitude.</p>

<p>'No,' she said, 'I didn't know. I'm very
sorry.'</p>

<p>'But why didn't you let Darcy know that
you were coming to London?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Hugo,' she answered, with a charming
gesture, 'I will tell you.' And she got up
from her chair and came to another one
nearer his own. This delicious action filled
him with profound bliss. 'When I read in
the paper that Mr. Ravengar had committed
suicide, I had just enough money in my
pocket to pay my expenses to London, and
to keep me a few days here. And I did so
want to come! I did so want to come! I
came by the morning train. It was an inspiration.
I waited for nothing. I meant
to write to Mr. Darcy that same night, but
that same night I caught sight of him here
in Sloane Street, so I knew it was no use
writing just then. And I didn't care for him
to see me. I thought I would give him time
to return. As a matter of fact, I wrote
yesterday evening. He would get the letter
to-night. I hope my disappearance didn't
cause you any anxiety?'</p>

<p>'Anxiety!' He repeated the word. 'You
don't know what I've been through. I feared
that Ravengar, before killing himself, had
arranged to&mdash;to&mdash;I don't know what I feared.
Horrible, unmentionable things! You can't
guess what I've been through.'</p>

<p>'I, too, have suffered since we met last,'
said Camilla softly.</p>

<p>'Don't talk of it&mdash;don't talk of it!' he
entreated her. 'I know all. I saw your
image in a coffin. I have heard your late
husband's statement. And Darcy has told
me much. Let us forget all that, and let us
forget it for evermore. But you have to
remember, nevertheless, that in London you
have the reputation of being dead.'</p>

<p>'I have not forgotten,' she said, with a
beautiful inflection and a bending of the head,
'that I promised to thank you the next time
we met for what you did for me. Let me
thank you now. Tell me how I can thank
you!'</p>

<p>He wanted to cry out that she was divine,
and that she must do exactly what she liked
with him. And then he wanted to take her
and clasp her till she begged for her breath.
And he was tempted to inform her that though
she loved Darcy as man was never loved
before, still she should marry him, Hugo, or
Darcy should die.</p>

<p>'Sit down,' he said in a quiet, familiar voice.
'Don't bother about thanking me. Just tell
me all about the history of your relations with
Ravengar.' And to himself he said: 'She
shall talk to me, and I will listen, and we shall
begin to be intimate. This is the greatest
happiness I can have. Hang the future! I
will give way to my mood. Darcy said she
didn't want to leave Paris, but she has left it.
That's something.'</p>

<p>'I will do anything you want,' she answered
almost gaily; and she sat down again.</p>

<p>'I doubt it,' he smiled. 'However&mdash;'</p>

<p>The sense of intimacy, of nearness, gave him
acute pleasure, as at their first interview
months ago.</p>

<p>'I would <i>like</i> to tell you,' she began; 'and
there is no harm now. Where shall I start?
Well'&mdash;she became suddenly grave&mdash;'Mr.
Ravengar used to pass my father's shop in the
Edgware Road. He came in to buy things.
It was a milliner's shop, and so he could buy
nothing but bonnets and hats. He bought
bonnets and hats. I often served him. He
gave my father some very good hints about
shares, but my father never took them.
When my parents both died, Mr. Ravengar
was extremely sympathetic, and offered me a
situation in his office. I took it. I became
his secretary. He was always very polite
and considerate to me, except sometimes when
he got angry with everybody, including me.
He couldn't help being rude then. He had
an old clerk named Powitt, who sat in the
outer office, and seemed to do nothing.
Powitt had just brains enough to gamble,
and he gambled in the shares of Mr. Ravengar's
companies. I know he lost money,
because he used to confide in me and grumble
at Mr. Ravengar for not giving him proper
tips. Mr. Ravengar simply sneered at him&mdash;he
was very hard. Powitt had a younger
brother, who was engaged in another City
office, and this younger brother also gambled
in Ravengar shares, and also lost. The two
brothers gambled more and more, and old
Powitt once told me that Mr. Ravengar
misled them sometimes from sheer&mdash;what
shall I call it?'</p>

<p>'Devilry,' Hugo suggested. 'I can believe
it. That would be his idea of a good joke.'</p>

<p>'By-and-by I learnt that they were in
serious difficulties. Young Powitt was
married, but his wife left him&mdash;I believe he
had taken to drink. There was a glass partition
between my room and Mr. Ravengar's&mdash;ground
glass at the bottom, clear glass at the
top. One night, after hours, I went back to the
office for an umbrella which I had forgotten,
and I found young Powitt trying to open the
petty-cash-box in my room. He had not
succeeded, and I just told him to go, and that
I should forget I had seen him there. He
kissed my hand. And just then the outer
door of the office opened, and someone
entered. I turned off the light in my room.
Young Powitt crouched down. It was Mr.
Ravengar. He went to his own room. I
jumped on a chair, and looked through the
glass screen. Old Powitt was hanging by the
neck from the brass curtain-rod in Mr.
Ravengar's room. While young Powitt was
trying to get out of their difficulties by
thieving, old Powitt had taken a shorter way.
Mr. Ravengar looked at the body swinging
there, and I heard him say, "Ah!" Like
that!'</p>

<p>'Great heaven!' cried Hugo, 'you've been
through sufficient in your time!'</p>

<p>'Yes.' Camilla paused. 'Mr. Ravengar
cut down the body, searched the pockets, took
out a paper, read it, and put it in his own
pocket. Then the old man's lips twitched.
He was not quite dead, after all. Mr. Ravengar
stared at the face; and then, by means of
putting a chair on a table and lifting Powitt
on to the chair, he tied up the cord which he
had cut, and left the poor old man to
swing again. It was an&mdash;an interrupted
suicide.'</p>

<p>She stopped once more, and Hugo fervently
wished he had never asked her to begin. He
gazed at her set face with a fascinated glance.</p>

<p>'All this time,' she resumed, 'young Powitt
had been crouching on the floor, and had seen
nothing.'</p>

<p>'And what did you do?'</p>

<p>'I fainted, and fell off my chair. The noise
startled Mr. Ravengar, and he came round into
my room. Young Powitt met him at the
door, and, to explain his presence there, he
said that he had come to see his brother.
Mr. Ravengar said: "Your brother is in the
next room." But instead of going into the
next room, young Powitt ran off. Then Mr.
Ravengar perceived me on the floor. My
first words to him when I recovered consciousness
were: "Why did you hang him up again,
Mr. Ravengar?" He was staggered. He
actually tried to justify himself, and said it
was best for the old man&mdash;the old man had
wanted to die, and so on. Mr. Ravengar
certainly thought that young Powitt had seen
what I had seen. That very night young
Powitt was arrested for another theft, from
his own employers, and it was not till after
his arrest that he learnt that his brother had
committed suicide. He got four years. When
he received sentence, he swore that he would
kill Mr. Ravengar immediately he came out of
prison. I heard his threat. I knew him, and
I knew that he meant it. He argued that
Mr. Ravengar's financial operations had
ruined thousands of people, including his
brother and himself.</p>

<p>'But the inquest on old Powitt&mdash;I seem to
remember about it. Why didn't you give
evidence?'</p>

<p>'Because I was ill with brain-fever. When
I recovered, all was finished. What was I to
do? I warned Mr. Ravengar that young
Powitt meant to kill him. He laughed. Of
course, I left him. It is my belief that Mr.
Ravengar was always a little mad. If he was
not so before, this affair had strained his
intelligence too much.'</p>

<p>'You did a very wrong thing,' said Hugo,
'in keeping silence.'</p>

<p>'Put yourself in my place,' Camilla
answered. 'Think of all the facts. It was
all so queer, And&mdash;and&mdash;Mr. Ravengar had
found me in the room with young Powitt.
Suppose he had&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Say no more,' Hugo besought her. 'How
long is this ago?'</p>

<p>'Three years last June. In six months
young Powitt's sentence will be up.'</p>

<p>Hugo nearly leapt from his chair.</p>

<p>'Is it possible, Mrs. Tudor,' he asked her
eagerly, 'that you are not aware that in
actual practice a reasonably well-behaved
prisoner never serves the full period of his
sentence? Marks for good conduct are
allowed, and each mark means so many
days deducted from the term.'</p>

<p>'I didn't know,' said Camilla simply.
'How should I know a thing like that?'</p>

<p>'I have no doubt that young Powitt is
already free. And if he is&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You think that Mr. Ravengar's suicide
may not have been a suicide?'</p>

<p>Hugo hesitated.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, and lapsed into reflection.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>'I shall see you home,' he said.</p>

<p>'I am going to walk,' she replied. 'And
I have to get my things from the cloak-room.'</p>

<p>'I will walk with you,' he said.</p>

<p>'What style the woman has!' he thought,
enraptured.</p>

<p>They proceeded southwards in silence.
Then suddenly she asked how he had left
Mr. Darcy, and they began to talk about
Darcy and Paris. Hugo encouraged her.
He wished to know the worst.</p>

<p>'Except my father,' she said, 'I have never
met anyone with more sense than Mr. Darcy,
or anyone more kind. I might have been
dead now if it hadn't been for Mr. Darcy.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Darcy is a very decent fellow,' Hugo
remarked experimentally.</p>

<p>She turned and gave him a look. No, it
was not a look; it was the merest fraction of
a look, but it withered him up.</p>

<p>'She loves him!' he thought. 'And what's
more, if she hadn't made up her mind to
marry him, she wouldn't be so precious easy
and facile and friendly with me. I might
have guessed that.'</p>

<p>They passed Victoria Station, and came
into Horseferry Road. She had informed
him that she had taken a furnished room in
Horseferry Road. The high and sinister
houses appeared unspeakably and disgracefully
mean to him in the wintry gloom of the
gaslights. She halted before a tenement that
seemed even more odious than its neighbours.
Was it possible that she should exist in such
a quarter? The idea sickened him.</p>

<p>'Which floor?' he questioned.</p>

<p>'Oh,' she laughed, 'the top, the fifth.
Good-night, Mr. Hugo.'</p>

<p>He pictured the mean and frowsy room,
and shuddered. Yet what could he do?
What right had he to interfere, to criticise,
to ameliorate?</p>

<p>'Good-night,' she repeated, and in a
moment she had opened the door with a latchkey
and disappeared. He stood staring at the
door. He had by no means finished saying
all that he meant to say to her. He must
talk to her further. He must show her that
he could not be dismissed in that summary
fashion. He mounted the two dirty steps,
and rang the bell in a determined manner.
He heard it tinkle distantly.</p>

<p>She was divine, adorable, marvellous, and
far beyond the deserts of any man; but she
had not shaken hands with him, and she had
treated him as she might have treated one of
the shopwalkers. Moreover, the question of
to-morrow had to be decided.</p>

<p>There was no answer to the bell, and he
rang again, with an increase of energy.</p>

<p>Then he perceived through the fanlight an
illumination in the hall. The door opened
cautiously, as such doors always do open, and
a middle-aged man in a dressing-gown stood
before him. In the background he descried
a small table with a candle on it, and the foul,
polished walls of the narrow lobby&mdash;a representative
London lodging-house.</p>

<p>'I want to see Mrs. Tudor,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>'Well, she ain't in at the moment,' replied
the man.</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' Hugo corrected him, 'I saw
her enter a minute ago with her latchkey.'</p>

<p>'No, you didn't,' the man persisted. 'I'm
the landlord of this house, and I've been in
my room at the back, and nobody's come in
this last half-hour, for I can see the 'all and
the stairs as I sits in my chair.'</p>

<p>'Wait a moment,' said Hugo; and he retreated
to the kerb, in the expectation of
being able to descry Camilla's light in the
fifth story.</p>

<p>'Oh, you can look,' the landlord observed
loftily, divining his intention; 'I warrant
there's no light there.'</p>

<p>And there was not.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you'll call again,' said the landlord
suavely.</p>

<p>'I suppose you haven't got a room to let?'
Hugo demanded, fumbling about in his brain
for a plan to meet this swift crisis.</p>

<p>'I can't tell you till my wife comes home.'</p>

<p>'And when will that be?'</p>

<p>'That'll be to-morrow.'</p>

<p>The door was banged to. Hugo rang again,
wrathfully, but the door remained obstinate.</p>

<h2>CHLOROFORM</h2>

<p>'Come in,' said Simon grandly, in response to
a knock.</p>

<p>He was seated in his master's chair in the
dome, which was lit as though for a f&ecirc;te.
The clock showed the hour of nine.</p>

<p>Albert entered.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's you, is it?' exclaimed Albert.
'Where's the governor?'</p>

<p>'I don't know where he is. He was in his
office at something to seven, having an interview
with Mrs. Tudor. Since then&mdash;'</p>

<p>Simon raised his eyebrows, and Albert
expressed a similar sentiment by means of a
whistle.</p>

<p>'Then, you've been telephoning on your
own for me to come up?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'It's like your cheek!' Albert complained,
calmly perching himself on the top of the
grand piano.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it will be. I regret to tear you
from your fireside, Alb, but I wish to consult
you on a matter affecting the governor.'</p>

<p>'Go ahead, then,' said Albert. 'There's
been enough talk about the governor to-day
downstairs, I should hope.'</p>

<p>'You mean in reference to Mrs. Tudor's
reappearance?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' Albert imitated Simon's carefully
enunciated periods. 'I do mean in reference
to Mrs. Tudor's reappearance. By the way,
what the deuce are you burning all these lights
for?'</p>

<p>'I was examining this photograph,' said
Simon, handing to his brother a rather large
unmounted silver-print photograph which had
lain on his knees.</p>

<p>'What of it?' Albert asked, glancing at it.
'Medical and Pharmaceutical Department,
isn't it? Not bad.'</p>

<p>'We're having a new series of full-plate
photographs done for the next edition of the
General Catalogue,' said Simon, 'and this is
one of them. It contains forty-five figures.
It was taken yesterday morning by that
Curgenven flashlight process that we're
running. Look at it. Don't you see anything?'</p>

<p>'Nothing special,' Albert admitted.</p>

<p>Simon rose and came towards the piano.</p>

<p>'Let me show you,' he said superiorly.
'You see the cash-desk to the left. There's
a lady just leaving the cash-desk. And just
behind her there's an oldish man. You can't
see all of his face because of her hat. He's
holding his bill in his hand&mdash;you can see the
corner of it&mdash;and he's got some sort of a parcel
under his arm. See?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Lecoq.'</p>

<p>'Well, doesn't he remind you of somebody?'</p>

<p>'He's rather like old Ravengar, perhaps,'
said Albert dubiously.</p>

<p>'You've hit it!' Simon almost shouted. 'It
is Ravengar.'</p>

<p>'This man's got no beard.'</p>

<p>'That comes well from a detective, that
does!' said Simon scornfully. 'It needn't
have cost him more than threepence to have
his beard shaved off, need it?'</p>

<p>'And seeing that this photograph was taken
yesterday morning, and Ravengar fell off a
steamer into the Channel more than a week
ago!'</p>

<p>'But did he fall off a steamer more than a
week ago?'</p>

<p>'He was noticed on board the steamer
before she started, and he wasn't on board
when she arrived.'</p>

<p>'Couldn't he have walked on to the steamer
with his luggage, and then walked off again
and let her start without him?'</p>

<p>'But why?'</p>

<p>'Suppose he wanted to pretend to be dead?'</p>

<p>'Why should he want to pretend to be
dead?' Albert defended his position.</p>

<p>Simon, entirely forgetful of that dignity
which usually he was at such pains to preserve,
sprang on to the piano alongside Albert.</p>

<p>'I'll tell you another thing,' said he.
'When I came in with the governor's tea
this morning he was just dozing and half-dreaming
like&mdash;he'd had a very bad night&mdash;and
I heard him say, "So they think you are
at the bottom of the Channel, Louis? I wish
you were!" What do you think of that, my
son?'</p>

<p>'Then the governor must know Ravengar
didn't commit suicide in the Channel? The
governor never said a word to me!'</p>

<p>'You don't imagine the governor tells you
everything, do you?' said Simon cruelly.</p>

<p>'Have you shown him the photo?' Albert
asked.</p>

<p>'No,' said Simon, with a certain bluntness.</p>

<p>'Why not?'</p>

<p>'Well, for one thing, I've had no chance,
and for another I wanted to find out something
more first. I'd just like the governor to see
that I'm not an absolute idiot.... Though
I should have thought he might have found
that out before now.'</p>

<p>'He doesn't think you're an absolute idiot,'
said Albert.</p>

<p>'He acts as if he did,' said Simon. The
Paris trip still rankled.</p>

<p>A pause followed.</p>

<p>'Another thing,' Albert recommenced.
'Even supposing Ravengar's alive, it's not
very likely he'd venture here, of all places.'</p>

<p>'Why not?' Simon argued. 'Scarcely anybody
knows Ravengar by sight. He's famous
for keeping himself to himself. He's one of
the least known celebrities in London. He'd
be safe from recognition almost anywhere.
Moreover, supposing he wanted to buy something
peculiar?'</p>

<p>'He might,' Albert admitted. 'But don't
forget this is all theory. I suppose you've
been making your own inquiries in the Medical
Department?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Simon rather apologetically.
'But I couldn't find anyone among the staff
who remembers serving such a man, or even
seeing him. He may have had an accomplice,
you know, on the staff. What makes it more
awkward is that there were two photographs
taken, one about eleven, and another about
half-past, and the photographer got the plates
mixed up, and doesn't know whether this one
is the first or the second. You see, the clock
doesn't show in the picture; otherwise, we
might have pieced things together.'</p>

<p>'Pity!' Albert murmured.</p>

<p>'However,' said Simon, with an obvious
intention to be dramatic, 'I thought of Lecoq,
and I hit on something. You see the lady
just leaving the cash-desk with her receipt?
Can you read the number of her receipt?'</p>

<p>Albert peered.</p>

<p>'No, I can't,' he said.</p>

<p>'Neither could I,' Simon agreed. 'But
I've had that part of the photograph enlarged
to-night.'</p>

<p>'The deuce you have!' Albert opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>'Yes, the deuce I have! And here it is.'</p>

<p>Simon took a photographic print from his
pocket, showing the lady's hand and part of
the receipt, very blurred and faint, with some
hieroglyphic figures mistily appearing.</p>

<p>'Looks like 6,706,' said Albert.</p>

<p>'It's either 6,706 or 6,766,' Simon concurred.
'Now, Ravengar's receipt must be
numbered next to hers. Consequently, if we
go and look at the counterfoils and duplicates&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Albert, thoughtfully sliding
down from the piano.</p>

<p>'We may be able to find out something very
interesting,' Simon finished, descending also.</p>

<p>'Now?'</p>

<p>'Now. That's what I wanted you for.
You've got your pass-keys and everything,
haven't you?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Then run down and search.'</p>

<p>'Aren't you coming too?'</p>

<p>'I was only thinking, suppose the governor
came back and wanted me?'</p>

<p>Albert gazed contemptuously at this exhibition
of timidity&mdash;the cowardice of a
born valet, he deemed it.</p>

<p>'Oh, of course,' he exclaimed, 'if you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'll come,' said Simon boldly. 'If he
wants me he must wait, that's all.'</p>

<p>They descended together in Hugo's private
lift, direct from the dome; the Medical and
Pharmaceutical Department was on the
ground-floor. Simon acted as lift-man, and
slammed the grill when they emerged.</p>

<p>'Just open that again, Si,' Albert requested
him.</p>

<p>'Why? What's up?'</p>

<p>'Just open it.'</p>

<p>Albert was sniffing about like a dog that is
trying to decide whether there is not something
extremely attractive in the immediate
neighbourhood. He re-entered the lift, and
nosed it curiously.</p>

<p>Suddenly he bent down and peered under
the cushioned seat of the lift, and drew forth
an object that resembled in shape a canister
of disinfectant powder.</p>

<p>'Conf&mdash;!' he exclaimed, dropping it
sharply. 'It's hot. What in the name
of&mdash;'</p>

<p>He kicked the object out of the lift on to the
tessellated floor of a passage which led to the
Fish and Game Department.</p>

<p>'I bet you I can hold it,' said Simon
boastfully.</p>

<p>And, at the expense of his fingers, he picked
it up, and successfully carried it into the Fish
and Game Department, where a solitary light
(which burnt night and day) threw a dim
radiance over vast surfaces of white marble
dominated by silver taps. The fish and game
were below in the refrigerators. Simon let
the cylinder fall on to a slab; Albert turned a
tap, and immediately the cylinder was surrounded
by clouds of steam. The phenomenon
was like some alchemical and mysterious
operation. And the steam, as it rose and
spread abroad in the immense, pale interior,
might have been the fumes of a fatal philtre
distilled by a medi&aelig;val sorcerer.</p>

<p>'I hope it won't blow up!' Simon ejaculated.</p>

<p>'Not it!' said Albert. 'Let's have a look
at it now.'</p>

<p>Albert had a mechanical bent, and, with the
aid of a tool, he soon discovered that the
cylinder was divided into two parts. In the
lower part was burning charcoal. In the
upper, carefully closed, was paraffin. The
division between the two compartments consisted
of some sort of soldering lead, which
the heat of the charcoal had gradually been
melting.</p>

<p>'So when this stuff had melted,' he explained
to Simon, 'the paraffin would run
into the charcoal, and there would be a
magnificent flare-up.'</p>

<p>They looked at one another, amazed,
astounded, speechless.</p>

<p>And each knew that on the tip of the other's
tongue, unuttered, was the word 'Ravengar.'</p>

<p>'But why was it put in the lift?' asked
Simon.</p>

<p>'Because,' said Albert promptly, 'a lift-well
is the finest possible place for a fire.
There's a natural draught, and a free chance
for every floor. Poof! And a flame's up
nine stories in no time. And a really good
mahogany lift would burn gorgeously, and
give everything a good start.'</p>

<p>'There are fifteen lifts in this place,' Simon
muttered.</p>

<p>'I know,' said Albert.</p>

<p>He approached a little glass square in the
wall, broke it, pulled a knob, and looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>'We'll test the Fire Brigade Department,' he
remarked; and then, as he heard a man
running down the adjacent corridor, 'Seven
seconds. Not bad.'</p>

<p>In another seven minutes nine cylinders,
which had been found in nine different lifts,
were sizzling beside Albert's original discovery.
The other five lifts appeared to have been
omitted from this colossal scheme for providing
London with a pyrotechnic display
such as London had probably never had since
the year 1666. The night fire staff, which
consisted of some fifty men, had laid hose on
to every hydrant, and were taking instructions
from their chief for the incessant patrol of the
galleries.</p>

<p>'See here,' said Albert, 'we'd better go on
with what we started of now.'</p>

<p>'Had we?' Simon questioned somewhat
dubiously.</p>

<p>'Of course,' said Albert. 'If that is
Ravengar in the photo, and if we can find out
anything to-night, and if Ravengar's in this
business'&mdash;he jerked his elbow towards the
cylinders&mdash;'we shall be so much to the good.
Besides, it won't take us a minute.'</p>

<p>So they went forward, through twilit
chambers and passages filled with sheeted
objects, past miles of counters inhabited by
thousands of chairs, through doors whose
openings resounded strangely in the vast
nocturnal silence of Hugo's, till they came
to the Medical and Pharmaceutical Department.
And the Medical and Pharmaceutical
Department, in its night-garb, and illuminated
by a single jet at either end of it, seemed to
take on a kind of ghostly and scented elegance;
it seemed to be a lunar palace of bizarre
perfumes and crystal magics.</p>

<p>The two young men halted, and listened,
and they could catch the distant footfall of
the patrols echoing in some far-off corridor.
That reassured them. They ceased to fancy
the smell of burning and to be victimized by
the illusion that a little tongue of flame darted
out behind them.</p>

<p>Albert gained access to the accountant's
cupboard, and pulled out a number of books,
over which they pored side by side.</p>

<p>'Here you are!' exclaimed Simon presently.
'Receipts. January 9.'</p>

<p>And Albert read: 'No. 6,766, Mrs. Poidevin,
37, Prince's Gate; vinolia. No. 6,767,
Dr. Woolrich, 23, Horseferry Road; chloroform!
Can't make out the quantity, but it
must be a lot, I should think; the price is
eighteen and ninepence.'</p>

<p>'Dr. Woolrich, 23, Horseferry Road?'
Simon repeated mechanically. 'Chloroform?'</p>

<p>'That's it,' said Albert. 'You may bet
your boots. Let's look him up in the Medical
Directory, if they've got one here. Yes,
they're sure to have one.'</p>

<p>But there was no Dr. Woolrich in the
Medical Directory.</p>

<p>Once more the brothers stared at each other.
Was or was not Ravengar alive? Were they
or were they not on his track?</p>

<p>'Listen, Si,' said Albert. 'I'll drive right
down to 23, Horseferry Road, and have a look
round. Eh? What do you say?'</p>

<p>'I think I'll come, too,' Simon replied.</p>

<p>In six minutes Albert pulled up the hansom
at the end of the street, and they walked
slowly towards No. 23, but on the opposite
side of the road.</p>

<p>'That's it,' said Simon, pointing. 'What
are you going to do now? Inquire there?'</p>

<p>At the same moment a window opened
behind them, in the house immediately facing
No. 23; they both heard a hissing sound,
evidently designed to attract their attention,
and they both turned their heads.</p>

<p>From a first-story window Hugo was gesticulating
at them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<h2>SECOND TRIUMPH OF SIMON</h2>


<p>'Come up at once,' Hugo whispered. 'Door
opposite top of stairs.'</p>

<p>And he threw down on to the pavement a
latchkey.</p>

<p>'What do you think of yourself now, Si?'
Albert asked his brother, as they entered the
house. 'You've let yourself in for something
at last.'</p>

<p>They found Hugo in an ordinary bedsitting-room.
He was wearing his hat and
his overcoat, and staring out of the open
window. It was a cold night, but he did not
seem to feel the icy draught which blew into
the apartment. The whole of his attention
appeared to be concentrated on No. 23. He
did not at first even turn to look at the
brothers when they came in. They explained
themselves.</p>

<p>'I will tell you why I am here, and what has
occurred to me,' said Hugo, playing, perhaps
rather nervously, with the knife and cheese-plate
which still lay on the small table by
the window. 'Then we can decide what to
do. I've hired this room.'</p>

<p>No doubt existed in his mind that Simon
had happened upon the track of the veritable
living Ravengar. It could not be a coincidence
that a man so strongly resembling
Ravengar, a man posing as a doctor, and
buying nearly a sovereign's worth of chloroform,
should be occupying rooms in the same
house as Camilla. The tremendous revelation
of Ravengar's genius for stratagem and intrigue
afforded by the recital of the two
brothers came upon Hugo with a dazing shock.
This man, whom he knew from Camilla's own
story to be curiously deficient in ordinary
human sentiments, had arranged a sham
suicide for the benefit of the general public.
He had let Hugo into the secret of that deception,
but only to cheat him with another
deception, and a more monstrous one. The
brain that could conceive the fiction of suicide
in the vault&mdash;a fiction which, while lulling
Hugo into a false security as regards Camilla's
safety, at the same time poisoned his happiness&mdash;such
a brain might be capable of unimagined
horrors. Sane or mad, the mere
existence of that brain was a menace before
which Hugo trembled. He realized that
Ravengar had been consummately acting
during the latter part of their interview on
the first day of the sale, and again consummately
acting when he spoke to Hugo on the
telephone. Ravengar had, beyond doubt, deliberately
set himself to lure Camilla back to
England, and he had succeeded. Beyond
doubt, all her movements had been spied and
marked, and Ravengar had been in a position
to complete his arrangements&mdash;whatever his
arrangements were&mdash;at leisure and with absolute
freedom. She had taken a room in
Horseferry Road, and he had followed.... What
was the sequel to be?</p>

<p>That she was in his power at that moment
Hugo could not question.</p>

<p>And the chloroform?</p>

<p>At that moment Ravengar had meant that
the Hugo building should have been a funeral
pyre&mdash;a spectacle to petrify the Metropolis.
And it seemed to Hugo that if Ravengar was
mad, as he must be, he could only have designed
the spectacle as something final, as at
once a last revenge and an accompaniment
to the supreme sacrifice of Camilla.</p>

<p>'We must get into that house immediately,'
said Hugo, when he had finished his own
narrative. 'The question is how?'</p>

<p>'I've got a card of Inspector Wilbraham's,
of the Yard, in my pocket,' Albert suggested.
'We might use that, and make out that this
purchase of chloroform under a false name
had got to be explained to the Yard instantly.'</p>

<p>Albert had recently become rather intimate
with Scotland Yard. Inspector Wilbraham
had even called on him in reference to
Bentley's death and the disappearance of
Brown; and Albert was duly proud.</p>

<p>'We will try that,' said Hugo. 'Have you
any handcuffs?'</p>

<p>'No, sir.'</p>

<p>'Go and obtain a couple of pairs. You
can be back in twenty minutes. Bring also
my revolver.'</p>

<p>Hugo and Simon were left alone. Hugo
spoke no word.</p>

<p>'I'll put the room to rights, sir,' said Simon,
after a pause. He could bear the inaction no
longer.</p>

<p>Hugo nodded absently, and Simon collected
the ruins of the vile repast which his master
had consumed, and put them outside on a
tray on the landing.</p>

<p>'There's a light now in the first story!'
exclaimed Hugo. 'I hope that boy won't
be long.'</p>

<p>And then Albert arrived with the revolver
and the handcuffs. He had been supernaturally
quick.</p>

<p>They descended and crossed the road.</p>

<p>'You understand,' Hugo instructed them.
'Let us have no mistake about getting in.
Immediately the door is opened, in we all go.
We can talk inside.'</p>

<p>'Supposing Albert and me went down to the
area-door,' Simon ventured, 'instead of the
front-door. We might get in easier that
way. It's always easier to deal with servant-girls
and persons of that sort in kitchens.
Then we could come upstairs and let you
in at the front-door. Three detectives seem
rather a lot to be entering all at once.
And, besides, you don't look like a detective,
sir.'</p>

<p>'What do I look like?' Hugo asked
coldly.</p>

<p>'You look too much like a gentleman, sir.
It's the hat, sir,' he added.</p>

<p>Simon had certainly surpassed himself that
day. He had begun by surpassing himself at
early morning, and he had kept it up. Probably
never before in his life had he been so
loquacious and so happy in his loquacity.</p>

<p>'That's not a bad scheme, Simon,' said
Hugo. 'Try it.'</p>

<p>The brothers went down the area-steps
while Hugo remained at the gate. A light
burned steadily in the first-floor window.
And then another and a fainter light flickered
in the hall, and after a few seconds the front-door
opened. Hugo literally jumped into the
house, and, safely within, he banged the door.</p>

<p>'Now,' he said.</p>

<p>A middle-aged woman, holding a candle,
stood by Simon and Albert in the hall.</p>

<p>'Are you the servant?' Hugo demanded.</p>

<p>'No, sir; I'm the landlady. And I'd like
to know&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Your husband told me you were away
and wouldn't return till to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Seeing as how my husband's been dead
these thirteen years&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We're in, sir. We'd better search the
house to start with,' said Albert. 'There's
three of us. The man that opened the door to
you must have been a wrong un, one of <i>his</i>.'</p>

<p>'Never have I had the police in my house
before,' wailed the landlady of No. 23, Horseferry
Road, while the candle dropped
tallow tears on the oilcloth. 'And all I can
say is I thank the blessed Lord it's dark, and
you aren't in uniform. Doctor Woolrich's
rooms are on the first floor, and you can go up
and see for yourself, if you like. And how
should I know he wasn't a real doctor?'</p>

<p>As the landlady spoke, sounds of footsteps
made themselves heard overhead, and a door
closed.</p>

<p>'Give me that candle, my good woman,'
said Hugo, hastily snatching it from her.</p>

<p>The three men ran upstairs, leaving the hall
to darkness and the landlady.</p>

<p>Whether Hugo dropped the candle in his
excitement, or whether it was knocked out of
his hand by means of a stick through the rails
of the landing-banister as he ascended, will
never be accurately known. He himself is
not sure. The important fact is that the
candle fell, and the trio stumbled up the last
few stairs with nothing to guide them but a
chink of light through a half-closed door.
This door led to the rooms of Dr. Woolrich,
and the rooms of Dr. Woolrich were well
lighted with gas. But they were empty.
There was a sitting-room and a bedroom, and
on the round table in the centre of the sitting-room
was a copy of the most modern edition
of Quain's 'Dictionary of Medicine,' edited by
Murray, Harold, and Bosanquet, bound in
half-morocco; the volume was open at the
article 'An&aelig;sthetics,' and Hugo will always
remember that the page was sixty-two. No
sooner were the rooms found to be empty
than Hugo rushed back to the landing, followed
by Simon. The landing, however, even
with the sitting-room door thrown wide and
the light streaming across the landing and
down the stairs, showed no sign of life.</p>

<p>Then Albert, who had remained within the
suite, called out:</p>

<p>'There must be a dressing-room off this
bedroom, and it's locked.'</p>

<p>'Simon,' said Hugo, 'go to the front window
and keep watch.'</p>

<p>And Hugo ran into the bedroom to Albert.</p>

<p>Decidedly there was a door in the bedroom
which had the appearance of leading into a
further room, but the door would not budge.
The pair glanced about. No evidence of
recent human habitation was visible either in
the sitting-room or in the bedroom, save only
the dictionary, and Albert commented on this.</p>

<p>'We must force that door,' Hugo decided,
'and be ready to look after yourself when it
gives way.'</p>

<p>As he spoke he could see, in the tail of his
eye, Simon opening the front window and
then looking out into the street.</p>

<p>'One&mdash;two&mdash;charge!' cried Hugo; and he
and Albert flung themselves valiantly against
the door.</p>

<p>They made no impression upon it at all.</p>

<p>Breathless and shaken, they looked at each
other.</p>

<p>'Suppose I fire into the lock?' said Hugo.</p>

<p>'We might try a key first,' Albert answered.</p>

<p>He took the key from the door between the
bedroom and the sitting-room, and applied
it to the lock of the obstinate portal. The
obstinate portal opened at once.</p>

<p>'Empty!' ejaculated Albert, putting his
nose into a small dressing-room.</p>

<p>With a gesture of disgust Hugo turned
away. In the same instant Simon withdrew
his head into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>'I've seen him,' Simon whispered in hoarse
excitement. 'He just popped out of the
kitchen and came half-way up the area steps.
Then he ran back. He saw me looking at
him.'</p>

<p>'Ravengar?'</p>

<p>Simon nodded. This was the hour of
Simon's triumph, the proof that he had not
been mistaken in the theory which he had
raised on the foundation of the photograph.</p>

<p>'Come along,' said Hugo grimly, preparing
to rush downstairs.</p>

<p>But a singular thing had occurred. While
Simon had been staring out of the front
window, and Hugo and Albert engaged in
forcing a door which led to emptiness, the
door of the sitting-room, the sole means of
egress from the first-floor suite, had been
shut and locked on the outside.</p>

<p>In vain Hugo assailed it with boot and
shoulder; in vain Albert assisted him.</p>

<p>'Keep your eye on the street, you fool!'
said Albert to Simon, when the latter offered
to join the siege of the door.</p>

<p>Hugo and Albert multiplied their efforts.</p>

<p>'There's a cab driven up,' Simon informed
them from the window. 'A man's got out.
Now he's gone down the area steps. They're
carrying something up, something big. Oh!
look here, I must help you.'</p>

<p>And Simon ran to the door. Before the
triple assault it fell at last, and the three
tumbled pell-mell downstairs into the hall.
The front-door was open.</p>

<p>A cab was just driving away. It drove
rapidly, very rapidly.</p>

<p>'After it!' Hugo commanded.</p>

<p>The hunt was up.</p>

<p>Two minutes afterwards another cab drove
up to the door.</p>

<p>Ravengar and another man emerged from
the area holding between them the form of a
woman. They got leisurely into the cab with
the woman and departed.</p>

<h2>THE CEMETERY</h2>


<p>Both Simon and Albert easily outran Hugo,
and, fast as the first cab was travelling, they
had gained on it by the time it turned into
Victoria Street. And at the turning an incident
happened. The driver, though hurried,
was apparently to a certain extent careful
and cautious, but he did not altogether avoid
contact with a policeman at the corner. The
policeman was obliged to step sharply out of
the way of the cab, and even then the sleeve
of his immaculate tunic was soiled by contact
with the hind-wheel of the vehicle. Now, the
driver might have scraped an ordinary person
with impunity, and passed on unchallenged;
he might even have soiled the sleeve of a
veteran policeman and got nothing worse
than a sharp word of censure and a fragment
of good advice. But this particular policeman
was quite a new policeman, whose dignity
was as delicate and easily smirched as his
beautiful shining tunic. And the result was
that the cabby had to stop, give his number,
and listen to a lecture.</p>

<p>Simon and Albert formed part of the
audience for the lecture. It did not, however,
interest them, for they had instantly
perceived that the cab was empty.</p>

<p>Then, as the lecturer was growing eloquent,
Hugo arrived, and was informed of the emptiness
of the vehicle.</p>

<p>'It was just a trick,' Simon exclaimed; 'a
trick to get us out of the house.'</p>

<p>'We must go back,' said Hugo, breathless.</p>

<p>At this moment the second cab appeared,
was delayed a moment by the multitude
listening to the lecture, and passed westwards
into Victoria Street.</p>

<p>'They're in that!' cried Simon.</p>

<p>'Are you sure?' Hugo questioned.</p>

<p>'Of course I'm sure,' said Simon, who in
the excitement of the trail had ceased to be
a valet.</p>

<p>To jump into a hansom and order the driver
to keep the four-wheeler in sight ought to
have been the work of a few seconds, but it
occurred, as invariably occurs when a hansom
is urgently needed, that no hansom was available.
The four-wheeler was receding at a
moderate rate in the direction of the Grosvenor
Hotel.</p>

<p>'Run after it!' said Hugo. 'I'll get a cab
in the station-yard and follow.'</p>

<p>The quarry vanished round a corner just
as they tumbled into the hansom on the top
of Hugo, but it was never out of observation
for more than a quarter of a minute. Through
divers strange streets it came at length into
Fulham Road at Elm Place, and thenceforward,
at a higher rate of speed, it kept to the
main thoroughfare. The procession passed
the workhouse and the Redcliffe Arms. Between
Edith Grove and Stamford Bridge the
roadway was up for fundamental repairs, and
omnibuses were being diverted down Edith
Grove to King's Road. A policeman at the
corner spoke to the driver of the four-wheeler,
gave a sign of assent, and the four-wheeler
went straight onwards into a medley of wood-blocks,
which was all that was left of Fulham
Road. The hansom followed intrepidly, and
then its three occupants were conscious of a
sudden halt.</p>

<p>'Bobby wants to know where you're
going to,' said the driver, opening the
trap.</p>

<p>There was a slight hesitation, and the policeman's
voice could be heard:</p>

<p>'Come out of it!'</p>

<p>'We're following that four-wheeler,' Hugo
was about to say, but he perceived the absurdity
of saying such a thing in cold blood
to a policeman.</p>

<p>All three descended. The cabman had to
be paid. There was a difficulty about finding
change&mdash;one of those silly and ridiculous difficulties
that so frequently supervene in crises
otherwise grave; in short, a succession of
trifling delays, each of which might easily
have been obviated by perfect forethought,
or by perfect accord between the three men.</p>

<p>When next they came to close quarters
with the four-wheeler it was leisurely driving
away empty from a small semi-detached
house which was separated from the road
by a tiny garden. They ran into the garden.
The one thing that flourished in it was a 'To
Let' notice. The front-door, shaded by unpruned
trees, was shut, and there were cobwebs
on the handle, as Hugo plainly saw
when he struck a match. They hastened
round to the back of the house, where was a
larger garden. A French window gave access
to the house. This French window yielded
at once to a firm push. The three men
searched the ground-floor and found nothing.
They then ascended the stairs and equally
found nothing. The house must have been
empty for many months. From the first-floor
window at the back Hugo gazed out,
baffled. Far off he could see lights of houses,
but the foreground was all darkness and
mystery.</p>

<p>'What lies between us and those lights?'
he asked.</p>

<p>'It must be Brompton Cemetery, sir,' said
Albert. 'The garden gives on the cemetery,
I expect.'</p>

<p>As if suddenly possessed by a demon, Hugo
flew out of the room, down the stairs, into the
garden. At the extremity of the garden was
a brick wall, and against the wall were two
extremely convenient barrels; they might
have been placed there specially for the occasion.
In an instant he was in the cemetery.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The remainder of the adventure survives
in Hugo's memory like a sort of night-picture
in which all the minor details of life are lost
in large, vague glooms, and only the central
figures of the composition emerge clearly, in
a sharp and striking brilliance, against the
mysterious background.</p>

<p>He knew himself in the cemetery, and immediately,
by a tremendous effort of the brain,
he had arranged his knowledge of the place
and decided exactly where he was. Instinctively
he ran by side-alleys till he came to
the broad central way which cuts this vast
field of the dead north and south. He hurried
northwards, and when he had gone about a
hundred and fifty yards he turned to the left,
and then went north again.</p>

<p>'It's here,' he muttered.</p>

<p>He was in the middle of that strange and
sinister city within a city, that flat expanse
of silence, decay, and putrefaction which is
surrounded on every side by the pulsating
arteries of London. The living visit the dead
during the day, but at night the dead are left
to themselves, and the very flowers which
embroider their dissolution close up and forget
them. Round about him everywhere trees
and shrubs moved restlessly and plaintively
in the night breeze; the angular grave-stones
raised their kindly lies in the darkness. A
few stars flickered in the sky; no moon. And
miles off, so it seemed, north, south, east, and
west, the yellow lights of human habitations,
the lights of warm rooms where living people
were so engaged in the business of being alive
that they actually forgot death&mdash;these lights
winked to each other across the waste and
desolation of a hundred thousand tombs.</p>

<p>With the certainty of a blind man, the
assurance of a seer who has divined what the
future holds, he approached the vault. He
was aware that the little gate in the railing
would be open. It was. He was aware that
the iron door in the side of the vault would
be unlocked. It was. He pushed it and
entered. All difficulties and hindrances had
been removed. No odour of death greeted
his nostrils, unless the strong smell of chloroform
can be called the odour of death. He
struck a match. The first thing he saw was
a candle and a screwdriver, and then the
match blew out. The door of the vault was
ajar, and he would not close it. He dared
not. He struck another match and put it
to the candle, and the vault was full of
jumping shadows. And he looked and looked
again. Yes, down in that corner she lay,
motionless, lifeless, done with for ever and
ever. Only her face was visible. The rest
of her seemed to be covered with a man's
overcoat, flung hastily down. He stared,
enchanted by the horror. What was that
white stuff round her head? Part of it
seemed to be torn, and a strip fluttered across
her closed eyelids. He went nearer. He
touched&mdash;cold! Could she be so soon cold?
And then the truth swept over him, and
almost swept his senses away, that this
image in the corner was not she, but merely
that waxen thing made by the sculptor in
Paris, that counterfeit which had deceived
him in the drawing-room of the flat.</p>

<p>Then where was she? And why was not
this counterfeit in its coffin, in which it had
been buried with all the rites of the Church?
The coffin? Yes, the coffin was there at his
feet, with its brass plate, which had rusted
at the corners; and below it, in some undefined
depth, was another coffin, the sarcophagus
of Tudor himself. He stooped and
shifted the candle. On Camilla's coffin were
a number of screws, rolled about in various
directions; only one screw was in its place.
He seized the screwdriver&mdash;and in that
moment a tiny part of his intelligence found
leisure to decide that this screwdriver was
slightly longer than the one he had used
aforetime for a similar purpose&mdash;and he unscrewed
the solitary screw and raised the lid
of the coffin, letting all the screws roll off it
with a great rattle.... An overwhelming
rush of chloroform vapour escaped.... She
lay within, dressed in her black dress, and
her dress had been crammed into the coffin
hastily, madly, and was thrust down in thick,
disorderly folds about her feet, and her hair
half covered her face. And her face was
slightly flushed, and her eyelids quivered,
and the cheeks were warm. He put his
hands under her armpits and wrenched her
out and carried her from the vault. And
then he sank to the ground sobbing.</p>

<p>What caused him to sob? If any man
dared now to ask him, and if he dared to
answer, he might reply that it was not grief
nor joy, nor the reaction from an intolerable
strain, but simply the idea of the terrific and
heart-breaking cruelty of Ravengar which had
dragged from him a sob.</p>

<p>The path followed by the madman's brain
was easy to pursue once the clue found. He
had been cheated into the belief that Camilla's
body rested in that coffin, and when he had
discovered that it did not rest there he had
determined that the mistake should be rectified,
the false made true. That had seemed
to him logical and just. She was supposed
to be in the coffin; she should really be in the
coffin; she should be forced and jammed into
it. And his lunatic and inhuman fancy had
added even to that conception. She should
be drugged and carried to the vault, and
drugged again, and then immured, unconscious,
but alive; and if by chance she awoke
from the chloroform sleep after he had finished
screwing in the screws, so much the better!
So it was that his mind had worked. And the
scheme had been executed with that courage,
that calmness, that audacity, that minute
attention to detail, of which only madmen at
their maddest appear to be capable. Beyond
any question the scheme would have succeeded
had not Hugo, the moment Albert Shawn
uttered the word 'cemetery,' perceived the
general trend of it in a single wondrous flash
of intuition. He had guessed it, and even
while afraid to believe that he was right, had
known absolutely and convincingly that he
was right.</p>

<p>Camilla murmured some phrase, and gave
a sigh as she lay on the gravelled path.</p>

<p>She had recovered from the fatal torpor in
the cool night air. He said nothing, because
he felt that he could do nothing else. Albert
and Simon were certainly looking for him in
the maze of the cemetery; they would find
him soon. It did not seem to him extraordinary
that he had left them in that sudden,
swift fashion without a word.</p>

<p>Then he heard, or thought he heard, a
noise in the vault, and, summoning all his
strength of will, he descended the steps again
and glanced within. Ravengar was there.
Had he been there all the time, hidden behind
the door? Or had he fled and stealthily returned?
Only Ravengar could say. He had
taken up the image from the corner and was
replacing it in the coffin. It was as if he had
bowed his obstinate purpose to some higher
power which was inscrutable to him. Children
and madmen can practise this singular and
surprising fatalism. Disturbed, he raised his
head and caught sight of Hugo. They gazed
at one another by the flickering candle.</p>

<p>'Where's the man who helped you?' Hugo
demanded faintly.</p>

<p>He had not much heart, much force, much
firmness left. Ravengar's eyes, at once empty
and significant, blank and yet formidable,
startled him. He had the revolver and the
handcuffs in his pocket, but he could not have
used them. Ravengar's eyes, so fiendish and
so ineffably sad, melted his spine. Ravengar
stepped forward and Hugo stepped
back.</p>

<p>'Let me pass,' said Ravengar, in the tone
of one who has suffered much and does not
mean to suffer much more.</p>

<p>And Hugo let him pass, inexplicably,
weakly; and at the end of a narrow path he
merged into the vague, general darkness.
And then Hugo heard the sound of a struggle,
and the voices of Simon and Albert&mdash;young
and boisterous and earthly and sane. And
then scampering footfalls which died away in
the uttermost parts of the cemetery.</p>

<p>And Camilla sat up, rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p>'It's all right,' he soothed her.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>

<h2>BEAUTY</h2>


<p>'Hum! he's going to marry her,' Simon had
said, and Albert had said, and Lily had said.
'I knew it all along.' When, at the end of six
months, Hugo went away, much furnishing
of rooms near the Dome took place by his
orders during his absence.</p>

<p>Yet here was Hugo back at the end of the
fortnight, radiant certainly, but alone.</p>

<p>'There was one little matter I forgot,' Hugo
began, rather timidly, as Simon thought, when
assured that everything was in order.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir?' said Simon.</p>

<p>'I want you to be good enough to give up
your room.'</p>

<p>'My room, sir?'</p>

<p>'To oblige a lady.'</p>

<p>'A lady, sir?'</p>

<p>'I should say a lady's lady.'</p>

<p>Simon paused. He was wounded, but he
would not show it.</p>

<p>'With pleasure, sir.'</p>

<p>'To-night,' Hugo proceeded, 'you can
occupy my bed in the dome;' and he pointed
to the spot where, during the day, the bed lay
ingeniously hidden in a recess of the wall. 'I
shall no longer need it. To-morrow we can
make some more permanent arrangement for
you.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Also,' Hugo continued, 'I would like you
to go along to the offices of the <i>Morning Post</i>
for me some time to-night before ten o'clock
and take this. There will be a guinea to pay.'
Hugo handed him a slip of paper.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Read it,' said Hugo.</p>

<p>And Simon read: '"A marriage has been
arranged, and"&mdash;and&mdash;has taken place, sir?'</p>

<p>'Precisely.'</p>

<p>'Precisely, sir. "Has taken place at Hythe
between Mr. Owen Hugo, of Sloane Street,
London, and Mrs. Camilla Tudor, widow of
the late Mr. Francis Tudor."'</p>

<p>'You are the first to know, Simon.'</p>

<p>Simon bowed.</p>

<p>'May I respectfully venture to wish you
every happiness, sir?' Simon pronounced at
his most formal.</p>

<p>'No, you may not,' said Hugo. 'But you
may shake hands with me.'</p>

<p>And he respectfully ventured to explain to
Simon how, in the case of a man like himself,
with three thousand five hundred tongues
ever ready to wag about him, absolute secrecy
had been the only policy.</p>

<p>'Telephone down to the refreshment department
for Tortoni to come up to me
instantly. I must order a dinner for two. My
wife and her maid will be here in half an hour.
I shall not want you&mdash;at any rate, before ten-thirty
or so.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. And the maid?'</p>

<p>'What about the maid?'</p>

<p>'You said you would order dinner for two, sir.'</p>

<p>'Look here, Simon,' said Hugo. 'If you
will take the maid down to dine in the Central
Restaurant and keep her there&mdash;take her
with you for a drive to the <i>Morning Post</i>&mdash;I
shall regard it as a favour. Catch!' And
he threw to Simon the gold token, which made
Simon master of all the good things in the
entire building. 'Make use of that.'</p>

<p>Simon felt a little nervous at the prospect.
He had not seen the maid. However, he
hoped for the best, and assured Hugo of his
delight.</p>

<p>'I forgot to inform you, sir,' he turned back
to tell Hugo as he was leaving the room,
'Doctor Darcy called again to-day. He has
called several times the last few days. He
said he might look in again to-night.'</p>

<p>The bridegroom started.</p>

<p>'If he should,' Hugo ordered, 'don't say
I'm in till you've warned me.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>Three hours later the bride and bridegroom
were finishing one of the distinguished Tortoni's
most elaborate dinners. Tortoni had
protested that it was destructive of the elementary
principles of art to order a dinner for
eight-thirty at seven o'clock. However, he
had not completely failed. The waiters had
departed, and Camilla, in dazzling ivory-white,
was pouring out coffee. Hugo was cutting a
cigar. They did not speak; they felt. They
were at the end of the brief honeymoon, and
the day was at an end. The last remnants of
twilight had vanished, and through the eastern
windows of the dome the moon was rising.
Neither the hour nor the occasion made for
talkativeness. Life lay before Hugo and
Camilla. Both were honestly convinced that
they had not lived till that hour&mdash;that hour
whence dated the commencement of their
regular united existence. They looked at each
other, satisfied, admiring, happy, expecting
glorious things from Fate.</p>

<p>There was a discreet alarm at the door.
Simon came in. It would have been a gross
solecism to knock, but Simon performed the
equivalent. He paused, struck when he beheld
Camilla, as well he might; for Camilla
was such a vision as is not often vouchsafed
to the Simons of this world. She was peerless
that evening. And she smiled charmingly on
him, and asked after his health.</p>

<p>'Your coffee, dearest,' she murmured to
Hugo.</p>

<p>It occurred to Simon that the dome would
never be the same again. This miraculous
and amazing creature was going to be always
there, to form part of his daily life, to swish
her wonderful skirts in and out of the
rooms, to&mdash;to&mdash;He did not know
whether to be glad or sorry. He knew only
that he was perturbed, thrown off his balance,
so much so that he forgot to explain his
invasion.</p>

<p>'Well, Simon,' said Hugo, 'had your dinner
and been to the <i>Morning Post</i> office?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Alone?'</p>

<p>Simon blushed.</p>

<p>'No, sir.'</p>

<p>'Good.'</p>

<p>'Doctor Darcy is here, sir. Are you at
home?'</p>

<p>Hugo had utterly forgotten about Doctor
Darcy. He glanced at his wife interrogatively,
but Camilla looked at the moon
through the window.</p>

<p>'Show Doctor Darcy in in five minutes,'
said Hugo.</p>

<p>'Poor old Darcy!' exclaimed Camilla when
they were alone. 'Does he know?'</p>

<p>'Know what? That we are married?
No. I wrote to him nearly six months ago
to tell him that you were safe and all that,
and he acknowledged the letter on a postcard.
Afterwards I sent him that trifle of money
that you owed him, and he sent a stamped
receipt.'</p>

<p>'He always hides his feelings,' said Camilla.
'This will be a blow for him!'</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>'Didn't he tell you he was most violently
in love with me in Paris?'</p>

<p>'He did not,' said Hugo. 'Did he tell <i>you</i>?'</p>

<p>'No, of course not. He was far too
chivalrous for that. It would have seemed
like taking advantage of my situation to
force me into a marriage.'</p>

<p>'How do you know he was violently in love
with you, bright star?' Hugo demanded in
that amiably malicious tone which he could
never withstand the temptation to employ.</p>

<p>'My precious boy,' replied Camilla, 'how
<i>does</i> a woman know these things?'</p>

<p>And she came over and kissed Hugo.</p>

<p>'You shall talk to him first,' she said. 'I'll
join you later.'</p>

<p>'Did he ever commit sublime follies for
you,' Hugo asked, detaining her hand, 'as I
did when I shut up the entire place because
I thought you looked exhausted one hot
morning?'</p>

<p>She bent over him.</p>

<p>'Darcy is incapable of any folly in regard
to women,' she said. 'That is one reason why
we should never have suited each other, he
and I. A fool should always marry a fool.
Consider <i>my</i> folly when I came back to work
in your Department 42 simply because I
could not forget your masterful face. Wasn't
that also sublime?'</p>

<p>'You never told me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But you guessed.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps.'</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand, and then that delicious
swish of skirts which Simon's imagination
had foretold thrilled Hugo with delight.
He launched a kiss towards her as she
vanished.</p>

<p>'We are all to be heartily congratulated,'
said Darcy, somewhat astonished when Hugo
had put him abreast of the times. 'At one
period I suspected that you were going to
make a match of it, and then, as I heard
nothing, I began to be afraid that she had
been unable to banish my humble self from
her mind. And, to tell you the truth, the
object of this present visit to London was to
inform myself, and, if necessary, to&mdash;offer her&mdash;See?'</p>

<p>Hugo was bound to admit that he saw.
Inwardly he laughed to think that he had
been seriously disturbed by Darcy's statement
in regard to the condition of Camilla's
heart.</p>

<p>'Shall we go out to the top of the dome?'
he suggested.</p>

<p>They rose.</p>

<p>And at that juncture Camilla reappeared.</p>

<p>The greeting between the Paris friends was
commendably calm, but neither seemed to be
able to speak freely. And at length Camilla
said she would get a cloak and follow them to
the belvidere.</p>

<p>The two men climbed to the summit which
dominated the City of Pleasure. To the east
the famous roof restaurant glittered and
jingled under the moon. To the west the
Great Wheel was outlined in flame&mdash;a symbol
of the era. Hugo told Darcy the history of the
night in the cemetery, and what preceded,
and what came after it, including the strange
death of Ravengar in a lunatic asylum, and
how everything was explained or explicable&mdash;even
Mr. Brown, the manager of the Safe
Deposit, had run up against justice in Caracas&mdash;save
and except the identity of Ravengar's
accomplice during the last days. He was
enlarging upon the inscrutability of that part
of the affair, and upon the interest which it
lent to the whole episode, when Darcy, who
had not been listening, broke in upon his
observation with an inapposite remark which
obviously sprang from deep feeling.</p>

<p>'She's simply marvellous!' cried Darcy.</p>

<p>'Who?'</p>

<p>'Your wife. Simply marvellous! I had
no idea&mdash;in Paris&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Recollect, you are not in love with her,
my friend,' Hugo laughed.</p>

<p>'She must have the best blood in her veins.
With that style, that carriage, she surely must
be&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My dear fellow,' said Hugo, 'beauty has
no rank. It bloweth where it listeth. It is
the one thing in the world that you can't
account for. You've only got to be thankful
for it when it blows your way, that's all.'</p>

<p>A white figure appeared in the cavity of the
steps leading to the circular gallery.</p>

<p>'What are you talking about?' Camilla
inquired.</p>

<p>'Women,' said Hugo.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
